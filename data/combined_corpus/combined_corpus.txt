East Town Kitchen + Bar | I was really worried this was going to be a bad visit because the menu had few options, staff was uninterested in us and there was not too many people on a Friday night when every other place was packed but the food more than made up for it. It was PHENOMENAL. We got the lump crab and the classic smash burger and they were above and beyond delicious!
East Town Kitchen + Bar | Food was terrible. Plates were never cleared. Only reason this isn’t a 1-star is because the coffee was complimentary and it actually was good for drip coffee.
East Town Kitchen + Bar | Great beer from Taylor!
East Town Kitchen + Bar | Taylor did a great job accommodating our picky group
East Town Kitchen + Bar | Solid selection of beers on tap!
East Town Kitchen + Bar | Taylor was very fun and personable server! We had a great time at east town
East Town Kitchen + Bar | Omg the serves Julia, Leah, and Donna are the GREATEST!! Ultimate service. Superior charisma. Best restaurant I’ve been too!!
East Town Kitchen + Bar | Leah took care of us.  She was amazing.  Fantastic food, great drinks.
The National Cafe | Food is amazing, love the place. We get there early for our Table 1 at the window and enjoy the pastries and everything on the menu.
The National Cafe | It’s my birthday weekend, so of course I had to treat myself... and The National Cafe never disappoints 💎✨  This place will always be one of my favorite hidden gems in the city. I’ve been doing more DoorDash lately, so it felt so good to stop in and enjoy brunch in person. The vibe is cozy, the staff is always warm and accommodating with my dietary needs, and the food? A whole vibe.  The Vegan Ultimate Breakfast Sandwich and French Toast were both chef’s kiss 👌🏾, and that mimosa? The perfect birthday touch 🥂💜  If you know, you know... The National Cafe always hits. And since I’m in the Top 20% of Google Reviewers in the area, you can definitely trust me on this one ✨
The National Cafe | Excellent breakfast! Had the burrito, was fantastic. Will be back soon.
The National Cafe | Loved it, food was freshly made, hot, nicely seasoned and worth waiting for. My only Gripe is ordering off a QR code, some people aren't tech savvy and tbh, it seems a bit impersonal, love to have face to face interaction.
The National Cafe | Great place for breakfast with plenty of vegan options
Onesto | Excellent food, service and atmosphere. The lamb was superb and the pasta was fresh. Would go again.
Onesto | The presentation and taste is always great :) even when ordering delivery. Very thoughtful flavors and plating. 🥰
Onesto | Business dinner party, everything was wonderdul
Onesto | A group of approx 10 of us stopped for a cocktail prior to a wedding at a different venue in the neighborhood. We all had $15+ cocktails and were in the bar area not more than an hour, towards the back. We were approached at least 4 times by staff that we were basically “in the way” and made to feel very unwelcome. We were not rowdy or rude. Cute place but terrible customer service, I doubt any of us will be back
Onesto | Took my girlfriend to Onesto for her birthday dinner. We started with the blood orange mule and  black cherry old fashioned. Both drinks were really good the old fashioned was strong! We then had the meat and cheese board for our appetizer. All the accoutrements were so fresh and the sweet drop peppers were something I had never tried before. For entrees I got the Gnocchi with chicken and she had the Carbonara. One of the best meals I have eaten in a long, especially since moving to Milwaukee. I would highly recommend Onesto for a date night or special occasion if you’re in the Milwaukee area! 10/10 experience from start to finish.
Onesto | We just celebrated my eight-year-old son's birthday at Onesto—a restaurant he specifically chose! I've been coming here for over a decade (10+ years), and it never disappoints. Their menu is small but mighty, always featuring excellent new options that keep us coming back. The setting is ideal for any occasion, offering a choice between a lively bar/high-top section and a comfortable, quieter main dining room.
Easy Tyger | An Asian Gastropub | I love this place! 😍 My youngest fell in love with Ramen and this is his favorite. This place is birthday and date night perfection. The tonkatsu is my favorite but everything is wonderful. Oshi desu
Easy Tyger | An Asian Gastropub | Delicious ramen!
Easy Tyger | An Asian Gastropub | The Beefy Boy ramen was delicious and spicy.
Easy Tyger | An Asian Gastropub | This place has really grown on me. The miso and tonkotsu ramen options always hit the spot. And the pork bao buns are some of the best. I wish they had soju though!
Easy Tyger | An Asian Gastropub | My favorite ramen in Milwaukee, I always get the beefy boy! I also like the ragoons and pot stickers.
Easy Tyger | An Asian Gastropub | 라면에 콘옥수수가 좀 많이 들어간 느낌이지만.. 집에서 가깝고 밀워키 다운타운에서 많지 않은 아시안 음식점이라 좋아요
Easy Tyger | An Asian Gastropub | Amazing ramen place! Great staff
La Caribeña The best Caribbean family restaurant | Muy buena atención Rosi
La Caribeña The best Caribbean family restaurant | Overpriced for what it is, specially the side of avocado. Tip was included in our bill as mandatory for 2 people.
La Caribeña The best Caribbean family restaurant | La comida, excelente. El servicio? Demasiado servicial, si van de verdad pregunten por Rosi que ella es un amor de persona y los va a atender como se debe.
La Caribeña The best Caribbean family restaurant | This restaurant didn't put labels on drinks and I order the oreo for my son and the ferreor rocher for daughter because of their poor service my son was exposed to peanuts and he is allergic to nuts... They are putting peoples lives at risk. Please owner put labels on your drinks!!!!
La Caribeña The best Caribbean family restaurant | Great experience!! Awesome food and the waitress (ANGELICA) was super attentive and very patient with our big group. Thank you Angelica!
La Caribeña The best Caribbean family restaurant | Amazing. Thats all words needed
La Caribeña The best Caribbean family restaurant | Muy buena la comida y la que nos atendio super amable Angelica su nombre
State Street Pizza Pub | It was amazing pizza and friendly service.  Will be back
State Street Pizza Pub | 10" Thin crust pizza with sausage was really good. Beer was flat. Service started out slow but got better.
State Street Pizza Pub | Great pizza! We were the only ones inside on a Thursday but the food was fresh and tasty. The staff were attentive and friendly. 10/10 pizza spot!
State Street Pizza Pub | Stopped in here while in Milwaukee for the Brandon Lake concert.  Service was excellent and the food was delicious, including the molten cake for dessert. My son enjoyed watching the Pizza Princess robot delivering the food to each table.  Reasonably priced for being a downtown eatery.  We will be back on our next trip to Milwaukee.
State Street Pizza Pub | Really good food and great service! We will definitely eat here again when in the area.
State Street Pizza Pub | Excellent pizza and service, complimentary parmesean without asking, with an old brick pizza parlor/bar vibes. Can't recommend this enough.
Screaming Tuna Milwaukee | Overall a great experience! Eva gave us amazing service! She was friendly, attentive, and made our visit feel special. The food was great, and her positive attitude made the experience even better. Highly recommend!
Screaming Tuna Milwaukee | Amazing service and food 10/10
Screaming Tuna Milwaukee | Don't get the mango roll! The tomato was overpowering and it just did not taste good at all. Also was spicy despite no mention on the menu. The veggie spring rolls were just okay but also not worth the price.
Screaming Tuna Milwaukee | the crispy rice tuna & lemon ginger edamame are my go to!!! never disappoints 🫶🏼
Screaming Tuna Milwaukee | Gorgeous presentation! 🤩I loved the Black Angus special roll and the Boom Boom Shroom. The spicy garlic edamame was amazing. Emily our server was wonderful and even gave me extra spicy garlic sauce to take home. Finally, the dessert cannot be missed! Extraordinarily unique dessert options including Matcha Tres Leches, Fried Rice Ice Cream with famous Purple Door Ice Cream. 🍨 Sushi and so much more with a lovely view! 🌃
Screaming Tuna Milwaukee | My second time. Tried a roll. It came out with just the roll, ginger and wasabi.  The wasabi nearly blinded me and burned a hole through me throat.  Half way through the roll, I was looking for my waiter because I really wanted sauce. Ended up flagging down someone clearing a table. Asked for a sauce and soy sauce. The soy was on the table. Hadn't noticed. It wasn't marked. The other sauce was an upcharge. Not mentioned, didn't know until I saw the check.  Friendly server, but poor service.  The roll was tasty. Tasted much better with the sauce. But I'll stick to my Pick n Save Monday Sushi specials.
Elsa's On the Park | The place is very welcoming beautiful atmosphere the food is very delicious the drinks is amazing 10/10 highly recommend it was my first time going oh my goodness I will be back time & time again! & a special thank you to my server Noah who checked on me frequently throughout the night to make sure I got serviced with everything I needed:) Me & my Bessie did a ladies date night here keep them bartenders I highly suggest the cocktails that taste was delicious
Elsa's On the Park | I’ve been visiting this establishment for over 30yrs. It’s been a family tradition the day after Thanksgiving for many years. I was shocked that they didn’t have the peppercorn sauce for the burger Au Poivre, and they only sell chicken sandwiches on select days. But, the worst was the service and the automatic charge of 20%, so the server Faith was not motivated to check to see if we had everything we needed, didn’t try to refill our water glasses, we had to ask someone else to bring ketchup, when we asked for straws, instead of wrapping in a napkin, she brought them loose with her fingers and just plopped them in our water glasses, and when she brought the napkin and utensils, she touched the top that touches our food and goes into our mouth with her fingers.  She never said thank you, and clearly, did not appreciate us as customers. I rarely write reviews, but this was by far one of the worst experiences I’ve had at Elsa’s or AZ88, which I visit often since I live in Phoenix.
Elsa's On the Park | I’ve been going here for years, and even after all this time, I think the best way to describe Elsa’s is that it’s just its own vibe—part bistro, part lounge.  Fantastic burgers, and they keep it fairly simple. It’s good food, interesting ambience, and a great place to grab a few cocktails and hang out.  I brought my young son, and he tore into his grilled cheese sandwich, so yes, they’re known for their burgers, but they definitely have other worthwhile options on the menu.  They’re basically a Milwaukee staple at this point. A great spot to start a night out—or finish one.  By the way, you'll get a postcard when you pay your check. Fill it out, and add someone's address. They'll mail it out for you.
Elsa's On the Park | Elsa's has always been a favorite since I moved downtown. They have great cocktails, the food is delicious as well. Went here a few days ago and got a mojito and a bigger mac burger. The burgers are epic. Another cool thing about Elsa's is they always have a unique art installation. Great place to grab dinner and drinks :)
Elsa's On the Park | 디저트 먹으러 가는 곳.. 식사는 아직 안해봄
Lucky Ginger | Food is horrible. I have had better take out than this place. We had a 8pm reservation and the first thing they tell us is you need to order your food right now. After we got our food, some lady sitting at the bar told us to get out of the dining room right after we got our food. DONT HAVE RESERVATIONS IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE PEOPLE TIME TO EAT YOUR FOOD. I would never recommend this place to anyone. Go anywhere else but here
Lucky Ginger | I ordered my food To go and it took 48 minutes to be exact! The place was barely busy at all and people came in with no reservations and got their food before mine. Like 5 couples to be exact, it’s like they were pushing my order back or something on purpose. After I got my food it wasn’t even piping hot like the takeout person said it would be. I wanted to try something new and I’ll never go to this establishment again.  I’m all about supporting small businesses but this made me really upset and I can’t support a business like this. I got a meal with egg rolls and it cost $26 and they also charged me a container fee. The containers cost a penny and they’re charging .60 cents what a ripoff plus they wanted a tip for ordering to go what a joke. I hope all customers aren’t treated this way
Lucky Ginger | Enjoyed our meal at Lucky Ginger! We enjoyed the spicy garlic edamame to start and then the curry and chicken Pho. Both the Curry and Pho were super flavorful and delicious!
Lucky Ginger | Ordered ginger noodles with tofu and got plain noodles literally no sauce or anything with chicken. No silverware. This sucked. My boyfriends broth is also tasteless. Awful.
Lucky Ginger | The pho is so flavorful, and I love that you can get the beef broth but choose your protein (or no protein at all). Portion are huge— in a good way!
Lucky Ginger | The food was very underwhelming in flavor! I ordered the special pho. The condiments they bring you are a morsel compared to the huge bowl of pho. It lacked that authentic flavor. I was disappointed the pho was 95% noodle and 5% protein. For the price I expected quality. I will Not he returning, just too bland if you're looking for flavorful pho.
La Dama | Mexican Kitchen & Bar | Great drinks.  Great food.  Great night!  Really creative food dishes that surprised and delighted us.  Pan roasted sea bass with green rancheros sauce and puréed creamed corn was delicious.  I love it when the food comes out so hot it burns your tongue.  It’s not had because the kitchen is so close to the restaurant - it’s behind the bar.
La Dama | Mexican Kitchen & Bar | Few menu options
La Dama | Mexican Kitchen & Bar | The food was very delicious but it was a bit overpriced for what it is. I simply don't understand why bone marrow is trendy.
La Dama | Mexican Kitchen & Bar | This cozy restaurant in Milwaukee is a very pleasant and interesting discovery! A couple of friends invited us there and everything was absolutely perfect: food, drinks, service and price. I highly recommend it. Thank you all! May life be beautiful to you, Mr Eman Korona, please continue to surprise our taste buds and our hearts. Colette.
La Dama | Mexican Kitchen & Bar | Small place, great food
La Dama | Mexican Kitchen & Bar | Beautiful patio and good drinks. However, the service was slow, the food was not tasty and were small portions and high prices. Also, when a customer says they did not enjoy something offer them something else or take the dish off the bill. We only ate a couple bits because we were trying it and hungry waiting for our server to come back. When we spoke with our server about not enjoying the dish she got incredibly disrespectful including telling us to read the menu (although we did) and that if we didn't "want" to pay for the dish that they are hiring (it's not about money it's about ethics). She was very sassy and left a very sour taste in our mouths. We will most likely never go back. There are plenty of delicious, reasonably priced, and wonderful latinx restaurants in Milwaukee. Peace.
Michael’s Family Restaurant | Service was great, staff was friendly and attentive. Food was fresh and tasty. The pancakes... Oh the pancakes have came a long way. They were so fluffy and yummy. My whole meal was good.
Michael’s Family Restaurant | The Sausage bowl and a side of bacon.q
Michael’s Family Restaurant | The service was quick and food was good. I hadn't been here in almost 20 yrs. They recently remodeled the restaurant. No WiFi. But it was a quiet place to grab a bite and do a little work.
Michael’s Family Restaurant | This restaurant was the absolute best. I ordered over the phone and it was ready within 15 minutes. Basically when I arrived, they were waiting with my meal. It was hot, fresh, and absolutely delicious. And the price was great, especially for the portion served. I was able to have seconds for lunch. 10/10 ... I definitely recommend for all visitors. I will most surely return upon my next visit into town.
Michael’s Family Restaurant | Was surprised by the overall pleasant experience, that part of Milwaukee can be  sketchy
Botanas Restaurant | Always an excellent choice at any time of year! Very welcoming, very tasty food and the salsa is First rate!
Botanas Restaurant | The fajitas & margaritas were good! Service was great too!
Botanas Restaurant | Plenty of parking and it even had a security guard booth. The outside and inside were nice. It has two different sections. It has like a sports bar and sit down area big enough for a sever large parties. Service was great.  The food was exceptional.  Great flavors.
Botanas Restaurant | Still thinking about how fresh everything tasted.
Blue Bat Kitchen & Tequilaria | Service and food was great!
Blue Bat Kitchen & Tequilaria | My friends and I got dinner and after we paid the waitress added an extra charge on a bill without our knowledge. Was very sneaky about it and when we called to get it fixed they said there’s nothing they can do. Disappointing customer service and will not be back
Blue Bat Kitchen & Tequilaria | Put additional $40 charge on my friends bill after she paid, and did not help figure it out. Just a bit disappointed in how they handled things
Blue Bat Kitchen & Tequilaria | Madison was a great server!!! Food was great. Highly recommend.
Blue Bat Kitchen & Tequilaria | Madison was 🦧🦎🪦🥳
Blue Bat Kitchen & Tequilaria | Service was very delightful. maddie made  our experience fun she very cheerful and has a beautiful smile and bubby personally!
Blue Bat Kitchen & Tequilaria | Madison was our server for a rehearsal dinner and was amazing! She went out of her way to check on our tables and food requests, and overall service was excellent!  However it’s freezing downstairs.
Orenda Cafe | We had a build your own omelet with smoked guda cheese, fluffly flavorful pancakes,  carnitias hash bowl get the green salsa to compliment it, Pineapple mojito cocktail, and some rich strong coffee.  Service was excellent! Very clean!
Orenda Cafe | Fantástico Sergio, te atienden súper rápido las meseras son súper atentas `` SI ERES UNA PERSONA BLANCA CLARO ESTÁ” hoy fui con mi familia llegué me senté en una mesa todo normal pero las meseras nunca nos ofrecieron el menú y mucho menos nos atendieron haaa pero llegó una persona blanca 5 minutos después de nosotros y ya tenía la mesera el menú listo para ellos antes de que se sentaran. Si eres latino o hispano ahórrate la molestia de ir no serás bien recibido hablo por experiencia propia
Orenda Cafe | Amazing food and service. The inside was so cozy, like walking into a hug. Definitely will be returning.
Orenda Cafe | The neighborhood needed this !!! perfect restaurant location - awesome staff - food different then all your average places -unique and soooo delicious!!!!!
Orenda Cafe | Waiting for food too long, tables are wobbly, waitress kept forgetting about my family’s needs. A bit warm in restaurant and coffee was cold. Food was very delicious
Orenda Cafe | Food was excellent, such a cute place and service was fantastic
Orenda Cafe | I always love the vibe here. The food is great and they have good Sunday specials
Orenda Cafe | The food was just okay, kinda bland and nothing to return for. The real kicker was how awful the bloody mary was. We got two different ones and they were both terrible. We didn’t even finish them. Unfortunately this place didn't live up to the hype.
Copper on King | Love this place. Upscale setting with chill vibes and tasty food. Creative cocktails (the beet juice “Beet Marshall” is awesome) and I can always find somewhere to post up and watch the game.
Copper on King | I had a really disappointing experience. it seemed like some of the employees were intoxicated and ended up getting into an argument with each other and yelling loudly.  They openly were talking about being intoxicated. It made the atmosphere really uncomfortable, and it didn’t feel like a professional or well-managed environment.  The food and drinks might have been fine under normal circumstances, but the behavior I witnessed from the staff completely overshadowed the visit. I hope management addresses this, because the place has potential, but the experience I had was not acceptable.
Copper on King | I think if you read through the majority of the reviews here, it’s pretty consistent with my experience. The poutine seems like the dish to order, but I can’t comment more than that because we didn’t get that.  I got the salad pictured. It was just ok. The French onion soup was good; my daughter’s chicken sandwich was prepared well but she didn’t love the sauce on it. The fries that came with it were terrible. Like “surprised that they would serve them” bad. You could tell just by the way they looked.
Copper on King | I had the lemon pepper and the peri peri wings and both were amazing. Indeed the wings are not your average fried chicken wing. The chef took his time to perfect the taste and texture. Also, I am a huge fan of the buffalo dipping sauce and ranch. The ranch was amazingly unique and delicious. Even the celery was fresh. Clean atmosphere and a must try if in the area
Copper on King | We got food for takeout - smash burger and chicken tenders. The only good thing about the food was that they gave a ton of fries (soggy but probably because it was takeout) and the portion was overall big. However, the burger did not taste good and the meat quality seemed poor. The chicken tenders were actually just huge chicken cutlets and tasted bland. The restaurant provided a bunch of sauces which was nice but still didn’t help the food. I’ve been to Copper before and the service when you dine in/drink is very good. I would recommend sticking to their drinks and passing on the food.
Copper on King | Went there Saturday evening of Cubs Brewers final playoff game, sat outside, lots of fun people watching and listening to the sparring fans. The falafel snack plate was good, the copper cubano sandwich even better. Server was Francesca, very efficient and friendly, did a nice job checking in with us, especially since food took a long time from our order to its table arrival. Shuttles were taking people to the game but we just had a two minute walk to our next destination at the Fiserv Forum.
Copper on King | Cheese curds were good. The poutine my husband got was delicious and SO flavorful. The smash burger I got had no flavor. The sandwich tasted like tomato, bun and onion. I tried the meat patty by itself, and it was bland. Worst burger ive ever had out. Tasted like it just wasn't seasoned. Also service was very slow. It didn't seem crazy busy either. We likely won't return.
Blue Star Cafe | I believe I've said this before but can't find my old review, but this is my favorite restaurant in the city. Worth repeating. GO HERE.
Blue Star Cafe | 소말리스타일 스테이크를 먹었어요. 매콤하고 맛있었음. 한국 사람이라면 좋아할 맛?
Blue Star Cafe | I tried the Somali steak sandwich and the Somali steak with pasta. Both dishes were amazing and they were very friendly. There will definitely go back again.i'm
Blue Star Cafe | Believe all the other reviews. The chicken sandwich is insanely good. Like, how? How is this so amazing?
Blue Star Cafe | Making magic food in here. Absolutely delicious! And so kind. Will be back!
Blue Star Cafe | Nicely food and clean
Blue Star Cafe | Best Somali food in Milwaukee.  I would recommend anyone to try it out.  I ordered Salmon and Rice.
Harbor House | The harbor house is An excellent choice for a romantic dinner or just to have a great meal with good friends.
Harbor House | Overall.  It was a pleasant experience.  Sam our server was great.  We went for an early lunch when they first opened.  Great Views.  Food & Atmosphere lived up to the reviews.  I would definitely go back.
Harbor House | All around great dining experience. Food was excelllent. Servers were friendly and attentive. Atmosphere was relaxing and pleasant.
Harbor House | As always Harbor House was excellent. We came for lunch. Our server Vicki was attentive, knowledgeable and nice and friendly! I had the cranberry orange Manhattan - yum! Holy smokes the special Nantucket scallops special was amazing!
The Knick | Excellent food and service!
The Knick | 괜찮아요.. 바 좌석에 앉으면 미식축구 (아메리칸 풋볼, 진짜 풋볼 아님)를 볼 수 있어요
The Knick | 10/10 I would recommend  Get the Fried Chicken sliders Loaded Tots Ask for Devin!!
The Knick | Good food with lots of choices (apps, salads, burgers, entrees) We all ended up having salads and all were delicious.
The Knick | Food is good, but please put a railing and light up your stairs in the entry. I fell and sprained my foot 🥲
The Diplomat | You ever had a bad day and just wanted a burger? Well, that’s how I ended up here on a Monday.  Burger was 9.8 / 10. I could argue that was the best burger I’ve ever had. At $18 it’s definitely the best I’ve had for the price. A bit messy so unless you’re a fast eater it would be a struggle because you don’t want to set it down. I’m here for a good time not a long time though so it works perfect for me.  My bartender’s name was Sam. Nice dude. It was honestly the perfect vibe for a crappy mood. He talked to me when I said something to him. Left me alone when I didn’t. Asked once how my food was. The music was great and they have a tv in eye shot if you’re looking for that.
The Diplomat | My wife and I had been here for drinks this past summer and it was on our list to try it out for dinner.  We went on a Friday night in December with 7pm reservations.  Everything was perfect.  We started out with a couple of cocktails from their menu while we waited for our table at the bar.  The bartender took special care preparing the drinks and they were delicious. When it was time to get our table and eat we were very happy with our spot in front of the window looking out on Brady street. The dining area has a great vibe and the playlist they had going was right up our alley. Our server was knowledgeable and on top of it. We had the chicken liver mousse, diplomat fries, cheese burger, trout and everything was great, especially the burger.  We will be returning soon.
The Diplomat | I went to this restaurant with my family on my 21st birthday which was a couple weeks ago.  The ambiance is perfect and the staff was patient with my older grandparents and explained the menu well.  The food and drinks were delicious and came out in a timely manner. No, it was not cheap, however for a modern fine-dining experience, everything we consumed felt as though it was worth its weight.  I recommend this restaurant for anyone celebrating an event or wants to spoil loved ones for a fantastic meal.
The Diplomat | Favorite small plate: Beet Salad Favorite entree: magret duck, or short rib All three $9 desserts are fantastic  I've eaten here 20+ times.  The menu changes.
The Diplomat | Too expensive, poor selection. Unhealthy menu. Fancy name but food is not. Not for me.
The Diplomat | 데이트가 취소되고 울적한 마음으로 와보고 싶었던 이 곳을 예약없이 왔더랬지요.. 맛있었어요 음식! 프레첼이랑 스테이크. 와인도 괜찮았고요. 디저트(피넛버터 파이)는 쏘쏘…
The Diplomat | Outstanding food. We came here on recommendation from a friend who suggested the burger. We ordered the sourdough bread, onion salad, Diplomac burger, and the trout. All of these dishes were fantastic. The sourdough bread was amazing with the compound butter - definitely try it. You must get the Diplomac. This burger may actually be the best burger I have had. It’s nothing crazy, just a classic burger but done so ridiculously well. The American cheese in every bite was just something else. If you like burgers, you need to try this burger.  Cocktails were great and the beers and wines were also good. Service was great - the bartender took care of the bar whole room, not just the bar. Massively impressive because he was super polite and welcoming alongside that. Ambiance was also just cozy and great for a laid back date night.  TLDR: Definitely recommend and get the burger. I cannot wait to come back!
The Diplomat | EDIT!!!! AND PLEASE READ! Amazing. The food..beyond any expectations and lick the plate clean...to the last bite.  HERE IS UPDATED REVIEW..PLEASE BEAWARE: Have always had a decent time at The Diplomat, until last night. The owners, both of them, are the rudest, condescending, zero customer service skills I have ever seen. My very lengthy YELP review goes into more and after reading a couple of the less than great reviews on here I see this is typical behavior for them. The female owner was rude from the start with aunt. We order small plates but our entrees were taking longer than normal. Bartender went to see what was going on. They missed our ticket completely and would make our food as soon as they could. I asked if something could be done about this and the wait. Apparently you aren't allowed to question thier terrible service. We were give two options. They will pay for our meal so far but we would NOT be served our entrees and we can leave OR they won't pay for anything and we will be served our entrees. It was ridiculous, I questioned why these were our options. The male owner and chef came out by us, yelled, belittled, made a scene in front of everyone. We decided to cut our losses and just finish our fries and leave, which we werent allowed to do. Female owner began taking our plates away mid bites.  They wouldn't let us tip the bartender- said they would, even tho we tried I was accused of only wanting something for free-NOT THE CASE AT ALL We were yelled at FOR THEIR MISTAKE YOU FORGOT OUR FOOD! Got home and immediately reviewed them at almost 10PM I started receiving calls from the Diplomat, which i rejected but they would call back right away. 10pm!?!? This is a very late time to call someone and EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL. No voicemail was left. From another review they must have been calling to yell at me again. Proceed with caution when you visit this establishment as one other other the ego of the chef is out of control. There is a high chance you will be assaulted at the least verbally by the chef. Really hope they do not treat their staff this way also.  To the Diplomat- DO NOT CALL ME AGAIN.
FiL FiL | I enjoyed the Fil Fil Mix Grill with Fil Fil sauce and the manager added a dried Fil Fil pepper. Staff is awesome, food fresh, made from scratch, and the regulars know one another and the staff - it's a place the locals frequent.
FiL FiL | Cheap open late very good food nice people very time in mke I stop in.
FiL FiL | If you need a quick late night bite or food at any hour, RUN, don’t walk, to this place. We stopped in for the first time tonight and had some of the best service I’ve had in a long time. The owner and the guys working were incredibly kind and welcoming.  We took everything to go, and once we started eating we all went quiet. That alone says it all.  Fil Fil is an easy new favorite, and I can’t wait to visit again next time we are here. Highly recommend!
FiL FiL | Owner and all the staff were super friendly!! They were open until 3 am, so it was the perfect spot to go to after a late night out. Some of my family members are celiac, and they did their best to accommodate—even giving us samples just to make sure we’d like the food. I would literally come all the way back to Milwaukee just to eat here again. Highly recommend their baklava! :)
Daddy's Soul Food & Grille | Enjoyed the Catfish
Daddy's Soul Food & Grille | Overall amazing the food here was great!
Daddy's Soul Food & Grille | The catfish, mac n cheese and greens are always good!
Daddy's Soul Food & Grille | I’m honestly done with Daddy’s Soul Food & Grille in Milwaukee. Every single time I order from here, they forget one or two items in my bag. And when you bring it to their attention, instead of fixing the mistake, they get rude and act like you’re the problem. The customer service is horrible — they talk to you like you don’t matter and definitely don’t appreciate your business.  What makes it worse is that they overcharge for the items they forget, give no apology, no explanation, and make zero effort to make it right. It’s always just “we forgot,” and that’s it. No professionalism at all. I really wanted to support this business, but the disrespect and lack of care is unbelievable.  Would not recommend.
Daddy's Soul Food & Grille | Daddys catered our mother's memorial with perfection! The food was hot and delicious and we could not be more happy.
Merriment Social | Great service, great food.. slightly too dark to see the menu, but love the ambiance
Merriment Social | Great brunch service, the monkey bread and shareable are perfect portions!
Merriment Social | It's a fun, relaxed place to meet with friends.
Merriment Social | We hosted our family rehearsal dinner and "night before wedding drinks for friends" here. Everyone had a phenomenal experience, with both the food and the service! It was the perfect place to kickoff my daughter's wedding festivities! Joe was amazing to work with to make all of the arrangements. Highly recommend for your event!
Merriment Social | This place is in a cool old garage of some sort. Great place for brunch. The food was a little different.
Saint Bibiana | Walked in sat down and no one took my order the next group came in and they were greeted and served, I grabbed my stuff and left!!! The total disrespect!!!!
Saint Bibiana | Good food . Killer service. Awesome place
Saint Bibiana | DJ runs the same BPM all night…after an hour gets a bit old. Other than that great service and a great place to get a drink
Saint Bibiana | Food is amazing@
Saint Bibiana | Breakfast all day. I'm super picky about my eggs and they nailed them
Tre Rivali | Well, I think it may have been short staffed but we waited about 25 mins to get a table and food was slow. I was a little more hopeful for my acai bowl, they even forgot my spoon. It's just not a tightly run ship, we came down because we're hotel guest. Hopefully this is received as constructive feedback.
Tre Rivali | beyond amazing service. bagel and salmon is deconstructed so beware. would recommend.
Tre Rivali | Always a great night - food is good and love the atmosphere. A definite go to on our list
Tre Rivali | Love the vibe of this place but was not a huge fan of their pizza. I recommend getting their pasta if you do come here as that was good. The service is great and can go upstairs to the outsider for a drink after dinner!
Casablanca | Chicken is delicious.
Casablanca | Vary nice people good prices and alot of fun
Casablanca | Isabella j is really hotter and very
Casablanca | Good food and drinks and Isabella j the hot one is the best bartender ever place would go down hill without her she’s the best ever
Casablanca | The food was good, but expensive. In total, it was about $200 for two meals, two appetizers, two drinks, and a hooka. It was alright, but not my go to spot
La Masa Empanada Bar | great food and service
La Masa Empanada Bar | La Masa is a must visit! Lots of options for empanadas including dessert ones. The initials on the empanadas was a great touch as well so you know which ones you are trying. My favorite was the Cuban!
La Masa Empanada Bar | Decent empanadas.  I appreciated how thin their dough was.  The combo meal is a decent value. Really appreciated that they had several vegetarian empanadas to choose from.
La Masa Empanada Bar | Alana was the BEST!! Made my experience so great and recommended great empanada options. Give this girl deserves a raise 😇
Café Benelux | What a wonderful experience in the domes. We were in the first dome and our waiter was fantastic. Upon checking in, the hostess had excellent customer service. She had great energy and set us up for a fun night. It was a beautiful view. We tried the cheese curds and cheesy bread, which were yummy. If you're considering renting a dome, do it!
Café Benelux | The food tastes phenomenal. Unfortunately, they brought me plastic silverware, which is a shame.  It's like drinking the best wine in a plastic cup. Fortunately in the half way,  they fixed. Great place in Milwaukee. One of my favorite.
Café Benelux | Myself and husband had a date night there in the heated domes for the first time and 10/10. Our server ELI was amazing! Food was delicious! We will definitely be back!
Café Benelux | We had such a great experience at Café Benelux. Everything we ordered was delicious. The cheese curds were cooked to perfection with a light, crisp breading that didn’t feel too heavy. The burrata tartine was fresh and flavorful, and the burrata and grilled veggie sandwich was outstanding—perfectly balanced and even better with the side of fries. We finished with the carrot cake, which was incredibly moist and the ideal ending to the meal.  We sat on the top floor, and since it was November, the space was decorated for the holidays. The atmosphere felt magical—cozy, warm, and festive without being over the top. A perfect spot for a seasonal outing or a relaxing bite with great food.
Café Benelux | Very expensive for little food
Mader's Restaurant | Unique food & experience.
Mader's Restaurant | Always a great experience, from the food to the staff to the atmosphere.
Mader's Restaurant | Popped in on Wednesday 11/3 for a cocktail and beer. Our bartender will gave great recommendations and made us feel very welcome. All the staff were very accommodating and showed us around. This bar is full of incredible historical things.
Mader's Restaurant | READ THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTION REPORTS BEFORE YOU CONSIDER EATING HERE.  I visited this restaurant when my friends regretfully chose to get married here back in June. A massive rat ran out from an employee-only area in the MIDDLE of their wedding ceremony in the private space you can rent on the second floor, to the shock and horror of all their friends and family. They had to issue to massive refund to try to smooth things over.  I promise their inspection reports speak for themselves.
Mader's Restaurant | Awesome experience, a Weider Rosemary friendly and accommodating. That's in on history at the restaurant in even invited us upstairs to look around. Portions were very large and the food was excellent.
Mader's Restaurant | Hats off to Mader's! And a very special thank you to Eve and also Vinny in the valet lot for assisting my elderly mother with parking.  You guys are the best.  Can't wait to come back!  EDIT-- We came back and had a wonderful family dinner this afternoon (11/30/2025). Mercedes was our waitress and she answered all our questions about the building, Mader's history and menu suggestions. She was great.  Thank you, Mercedes!!
Story Hill BKC | I just love the food here. I had the Crepe Monsieur for breakfast this morning and it was so tasty, with perfectly poached eggs, tender ham and tangy pickles. It was a large enough portion for two servings. Definitely recommend Story Hill for both brunch and dinner!
Story Hill BKC | Food was presented well, but it really wasn't as great as I thought it'd be. Flavor was just okay, definitely not something I would remember or make me want to go back, especially for the price.
Story Hill BKC | The food was fantastic, they know what they are doing! Great atmosphere, neat decor. I plan to go back
Story Hill BKC | Our favorite brunch spot!! Great food and service.
Story Hill BKC | This year, I’m a liaison for an exchange student from Mexico. Decided that for our November update we would go out to eat and we both loved it!!
The Edison | Get anything but the smash burger. $22 cheese burger with a side of  unseasoned backseat McDonald's French fries.
The Edison | While visiting the town on business, a coworker and I stopped in for dinner. I ordered the ribeye cooked medium-rare. Being from Texas, I make a point to try ribeyes in different states while traveling to compare the quality. Unfortunately, this one was very disappointing. It was overcooked and tasted as though it hadn’t been seasoned at all. I managed to eat about half before giving up. To make matters worse, it cost around $60 for a steak with virtually no flavor.
The Edison | Great food and service. We had the house salad, steak frites, trout and the pigs in a blanket. The cocktails are fantastic.  Great happy hour deals.
The Edison | You’d expect something special from the Edison’s prices and atmosphere, but the food is boring, poorly seasoned, and unimaginative. Absolutely not worth the price.
The Edison | Delicious espresso martini. The wagyu ribeye was the bomb. Beautiful and great date spot
The Edison | We unknowingly went during happy hour so they are switching between lunch and dinner so have a limited menu but got the wings and they were amazing definitely recommend.
Tauro Cocina | Really great pizzas and unique cocktails.
Tauro Cocina | I’ve been here twice now. Both times were amazing! The food is so good, and I Ioved the drink from my last visit. The red sangria was delicious! I recommend the cilantro risotto. It was so flavorful, and the shrimp was great too. On the last trip, we got the churros for dessert. They came out hot and tasted amazing with the raspberry dipping sauce. Can’t wait to go back to try the pastas next time!
Tauro Cocina | I’ll keep it short and sweet. 5th time here. Never had a bad meal. Drinks and service are excellent. The parmesan risotto with birria is out of this world. Come here are order it, don’t think twice.
Tauro Cocina | Got the cilantro risotto and birria pizza. Was insanely good and yummy!!! Great portion sizes too
Tauro Cocina | My wife and I had our rehearsal dinner for 40 in the Jardin room and everything was absolutely perfect! The food, service and planning was top notch. Their grilled salmon with cilantro risotto is a 10/10. Ahide & her family do a wonderful job. We couldn’t recommend Tauro Cocina more.
Tauro Cocina | The Spritz, the pizza, and risotto at Tauro Cocina reminded my wife and I of our honeymoon in Italy. Thank you for the memories and kind service.
Oggie's Kitchen & Bar | Came in for a last minute dinner and joyli was my server. Please ask for her when you come. Her energy is electric. She will make you feel right at home. The food was delicious. I had the calamari and tandoori chicken. Both very well put together. I will deffinatly be back.
Oggie's Kitchen & Bar | Good food slow service
Oggie's Kitchen & Bar | Friendly team and great customer care. Everything was quick and easy.
Oggie's Kitchen & Bar | This place was great! I have a food allergy and they were SO attentive (a rare thing). Good food, great atmosphere, and a great server (Kala) We will definitely be back!
Oggie's Kitchen & Bar | I went here for Happy hour for my Birthday 🎂.
Oggie's Kitchen & Bar | Not your typical hotel breakfast, this place was awesome, reasonably priced, and quiet! Look at that burrito!
Oak Barrel Public House | Average pub with Average food.
Oak Barrel Public House | We had a great server and food. I'm unsure of their name but they gave us great service and were very kind. Cheese curds are a must order and try a cocktail I had my 1st butter beer and was not disappointed.
Oak Barrel Public House | Cute inside, our server was good but waited an hour for our food which was not very good. They were out of multiple simple things like chips and bread. Apparently the whole kitchen staff is new. Very disappointing.
Oak Barrel Public House | Food and service was not great. My buffalo chicken wrap was cold on the inside. We asked for a few things when they brought the food out and the food runner just never came back. Our server was ok, could tell he was doing his best but very subpar service. Loved the Christmas decor here though.
Oak Barrel Public House | Had dinner before a game (close to Fiserv and UWM arenas).  Server was friendly. Food came out quick.
Oak Barrel Public House | Lovely atmosphere and wonderful burgers! My husband had the black and Blue and I had the Bacon Jam burgers- definitely coming back for these! Good prices for an upscale bar. We had a great server as well.
Mediterranean cuisine | I placed an order for beef kabob plate and chicken kabob plate  , pita bread and chocolate cake.    I drove 28 mins .  Food was never made .     This restaurant wasted my time , money and gas and worst I never got my food..    owners please see the picture below.
Mediterranean cuisine | Amazing food for an office lunch. It was ready very quickly and everthing was fresh and delicious!
Mediterranean cuisine | Had a delicious and quick chicken shawarma for lunch today! Would definitely get again!
Mediterranean cuisine | Delicious!
Mediterranean cuisine | Great food and very welcoming staff! Very reasonably priced and their online ordering system is a breeze! Perfect spot for lunch during the work week.
Swingin' Door Exchange | Love it here!!!The vermouth carrots are to die for!!! Love the staff, they are always very kind, great drinks too!!!
Swingin' Door Exchange | Classic Wisconsin pub vibes done right. Cozy atmosphere, great food, and genuinely excellent service. Everything felt welcoming from the moment we walked in. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a true hometown pub experience.
Swingin' Door Exchange | Small place but packs a punch.  Good food. Good drinks.  The old fashion they make is awesome.
Swingin' Door Exchange | TIGHT space, get there early or really late. Just enought space to accommodate the bar. Quaint 1980s bar... fun Food is top notch. Service is great!
Swingin' Door Exchange | On our first day of vacation in the fine city of Milwaukee my girlfriend and I had it in mind to enjoy a light lunch before an evening barcrawl. We found ourselves at this lively establishment the swinging door exchange. We came in around 1pm and the lunch rush was in full swing. We were seated within about 20 mins which was fine. We both imbibed in some craft beer and split the tuna melt sandwich with fries. It hit the spot contently. We had it in mind to stop by again before our departure from the city but it wasn't to be. However i believe i can firmly recommend this cozy eatery for a sumptous lunch or dinner.
Swingin' Door Exchange | I thought the food was very good. Its a friendly nice restaurant.  Not pretentious and not a sports bar. Very pleasant. Service was one point. Not pushy but stopped by regularly to check in. Good pace. Seating was cramped. There are several options they need to pick one.
Swingin' Door Exchange | Very good food really cool atmosphere or pretty good service.
La Chinampa | We happened upon this gem while in Walkers Point. I had the chimichangas al pastor dinner and my wife had two tamales. All of it was delicious and the space was cozy. They brought out 3 hot sauces with our favorite being the chimichurri. It was spicy but so delicious.
La Chinampa | I went to Milwaukee last year and I never would've thought the best Mexican food I've ever had would be in Wisconsin. I'm about to take another trip to Milwaukee soon and I can't wait to go back to this place.
La Chinampa | This is my go to place in the area. Pretty good burritos that taste better each time I go.
La Chinampa | Killer food. Came in during off hours and they made fresh tortilla chips for me. Enchiladas were great. Solid lunch deals
La Chinampa | If you want some good Mexican food, this is THE place to go. Honestly this may be the best Mexican food I've ever had. Prices are unreal for the amount of delicious food you get! I'd consider this a hidden gem in the city, and totally worth trying out!
La Chinampa | This is the best place ive ever been to! The birria tacos were so memorable that i know im going to dream about them later. The staff was very nice too.
La Chinampa | Great spot with great food and friendly staff
Birch | My husband surprised me with a dinner at Birch for our 5 year anniversary and it didn’t disappoint! From the minute we walked in, the service was impeccable and friendly. We decided to splurge the Chef’s Tasting Menu and the experience was unforgettable. We are both extremely critical of fine dining and we had no notes. My husband chose the wine pairing and was visited by the restaurant’s Sommelier, who was very kind and passionate in explaining the story behind the wines. From drinks to dessert, we left feeling like we actually got a deal for the amazing food, drinks, and experience we received. Special shoutout to our waitress, Rachel, who went above and beyond!
Birch | We had the pleasure of experiencing the chef tasting and wine pairing at the counter. This was excellent in every way - very happy with our meal and overall hospitality.
Birch | Cannot say enough amazing things about our Birch dinner experience! We came for my boyfriend’s birthday and we were blown away by the food and the service from everyone! Truly, run, don’t walk here. We can’t wait to return! Didn’t even take any pics of the food or drinks because we were enjoying the moment too much!
Birch | Exceptional menu and drinks. Very attentive service. Great ambience.
Birch | Went to Birch on my birthday and yes, the food was amazing, they took good care of every single product, bite, story… but I needed to highlight that the staff signed me a birthday card!! It was so unexpected that tears came to my eyes when I saw all of their names and birthdays wishes! Thank you so much ❤️ We live thousands of miles away but we’ll be back!
Birch | Was noticeably blown away by the service and friendliness of every staff member. My friend and I popped into the bar area before a show. Drinks, food, and service were all top tier. Will definitely be back soon.
Tupelo Honey Southern Kitchen & Bar | The food was really great with a southern flare . Disappointed that they didn't serve Boudin or etuofee.
Tupelo Honey Southern Kitchen & Bar | This was our first time here and we will most definitely be back! Our server, Sunshine, was super nice and provided great service! The food was absolutely delicious. We started with the Biscuits for a cause with blueberry jam. They were perfectly warm and tasted amazing. I had the Mountain Morning Bowl which was very good and unique with the grits and potatoes. My partner had the Smothered Chicken which was also a hit. The potatoes for both of us were done to perfection. Lastly, the atmosphere was great. The decor is so cute and has great lighting. Thanks for a great brunch!
Tupelo Honey Southern Kitchen & Bar | Fried chicken was not anything special. I will give it one more shot.
Tupelo Honey Southern Kitchen & Bar | The steak is horrible I'm sorry I have to give a review so the people know. It's not a steak that's worth it at all the taste and texture is not steak worthy at all. The potatoes are average. I love the fried green tomatoes and grits what an amazing dish that's all I would recommend from here. The waitress was great the people are great the place is clean and amazing looking. The food doesn't live up to the hype. My friend got another dish she had to send back because it wasn't made right and didn't taste right I can't comment on that dish because it was shrimp and I'm allergic!!!!! So j hate shrimp. The steak was really inedible remove it from the menu and replace it with a nice chuck!!!!!
Tupelo Honey Southern Kitchen & Bar | Great food, knowledgeable staff
Zarletti | Best in Milwaukee!
Zarletti | Perhaps the pasta is good  but the veal I had was like shoe leather and my wife's chicken was only slightly better...really terrible food and a bit expensive
Zarletti | Great food and expert wine pairing by Jackie made for a delicious and memorable meal. Can’t wait to return!
Zarletti | Absolutely loved our experience at Zarletti. Brianna was our server and did a phenomenal job. She was so attentive and had great suggestions. Our food and service was unmatched. Will always revisit when I’m in town!
Zarletti | Zarlettis was good, but I wasn’t as blown away as I was expecting to be.  The bruschetta appetizer was mediocre, bread was like toasted grocery store bread. The tomato was crisp and fresh.  Mushroom arancini was quite tasty but not sure I’d order again.  Lamb ragu pasta was very good, no notes.  Butternut squash and sage butter ravioli needed some work. It wasnt bad, but the pasta to filling ratio was off , the filling itself was somewhat bland, and the sage butter did not come through very well.  The drinks were great! Service was great!  All and all, not a BAD meal by any means, but for the price point and hype… I won’t lie I was expecting near perfection.
Zarletti | Truly exceptional experience!  My wife and I celebrated our anniversary dinner at the bar in 2025 and were treated like royalty.  Not only was the food outstanding, our bartender’s knowledge of the wine, food and culture was only outdone by his charisma.  Safe bet you’ll have a good time here.
Zarletti | Excellent in every respect.
Buckley's Restaurant & Bar | Excellent on every account. We ordered sourdough and lamb for appetizers. A couple cocktails and a bottle of red wine. For entree my friend had the mushroom pasta and I had the halbot risotto. Delicious. We had chocolate cake and carrot cake for dessert.
Buckley's Restaurant & Bar | I’m honestly blown away that I’ve never been to Buckley’s before… because this place is phenomenal. From the moment we walked in, the experience was excellent.  We started with cocktails at the bar, and Tyler crafted some truly beautiful drinks. Thoughtful, balanced, and made with care… such a great way to kick off the evening.  Once seated in the dining room, our server was attentive, warm, and lovely. We began with the carpaccio and a fall-harvest style salad (can’t remember the exact name)… both were absolutely delicious.  For mains, we shared three dishes, and I genuinely can’t pick a favorite… they were all outstanding. The prosciutto-wrapped halibut with mushroom risotto was rich and perfectly executed. The roasted squash and broccoli over peanut mole was unique, flavorful, and beautifully plated. And the housemade pappardelle with shrimp, fennel, and nduja was perfection… fresh pasta with incredible depth of flavor.  Everything we ate was balanced, thoughtful, and just plain delicious. Buckley’s is officially going on my heavy rotation… absolutely worth a visit if you haven’t been!
Buckley's Restaurant & Bar | Tried Buckleys with my family tonight based on a recommendation while visiting Milwaukee. Ordered the fried artichoke, the empanadas and focaccia appetizers, they  were all good. For our entrees we ordered the pork chop, chicken marsala and both my son and daughter ordered the pesto pasta. Pork chop and chicken were cooked well but both pastas dishes were very undercooked (seems to be a common occurrence as other reviews mention). They were not “al dente” but rather had a very starchy, hard to chew inedible texture so we brought it up to our server’s attention after the first bite, both dishes were lukewarm. He took both dishes back to the kitchen returning a minute later with an answer from the chef saying “that’s how they cook it and it is correct” which made for a very awkward moment. He offered to either leave us the dishes that he had taken back to the kitchen or that they could remake them. We asked for them to be remade since they were inedible, bringing the remade dishes about 10 minutes later when we were almost done eating our other entrees. The remade pasta was a little better but it still had a harder chew texture than what you would expect, I wouldn’t be surprised if the same pasta was just reheated, just not a good enjoyable dish. In hindsight offering to try a non pasta dish as an alternative would’ve been a better option if that’s how they serve all their pasta dishes. We didn’t say anything else since my kids were hungry and we were also celebrating my sons birthday, the overall experience had already been awkward. We did order the chocolate and carrots cakes for dessert which were very good. No manager came by at any point to check on the situation afterwards which I found odd for this type of restaurant and price point.
Buckley's Restaurant & Bar | We had dinner here on a whim on a recent visit to Milwaukee. I have been dreaming about their food ever since. I had the chicken Marsala and it was the height of comfort on a plate. The service was impeccable. And the atmosphere was delightful; we were lucky enough to walk in late and get a cozy table for two in the window in the bar area.  Loved everything about our experience. Will definitely be back!!
Buckley's Restaurant & Bar | Everything seemed fine. It was fine for my needs.
Buckley's Restaurant & Bar | We reserved dinner at Buckley’s based on reviews and it didn’t disappoint. We ordered the carrots appetizer, short rib pasta, and the pork chop. The carrots were so delicious - I usually don’t like carrots but these were fantastic. The short rib pasta was spectacular and the pork chop was very tasty. We also loved the cocktails 🍹 thank you for a great dinner!
Buckley's Restaurant & Bar | I couldn't be happier eating here either at the bar, dinning room or el fresco patio!
DOC's Commerce Smokehouse | Good price, great food, quick service.
DOC's Commerce Smokehouse | Poor customer service training,  blaming, mis information purposely    turned my appetite in knots of discomfort. Even called before I came,,,host Even said hold on let me make sure,,apon my arrival every one is dumbfounded and my time is waisted plus I wasn't made welcome it seems,,,they don't have to worry but enough people speaking out will have an effect. I wish you no success and much illness
DOC's Commerce Smokehouse | Solid smoked meats. Rather expensive, but to be expected from a city smokeshop.
DOC's Commerce Smokehouse | Food was hit-or-miss. Brisket was good, ribs were way overcooked and tough. No smoke flavor on anything. Not worth the price.
DOC's Commerce Smokehouse | Excellent BBQ and the service is top notch.  Dirty tots rock!
DOC's Commerce Smokehouse | We stopped in for dinner on a Friday night, the place wasn't too terribly busy. We were seated right away.  The place has a great beer and whiskey list, and they also have THC drinks on tap. I appreciate when we ordered the brisket they asked if we would like it fattier or leaner, that was a really nice surprise. The rib tips were pretty good, I would have liked a little more char on them, but they still were tasty.  It's relatively expensive, not unexpected at a  downtown hotel.
DOC's Commerce Smokehouse | Great food. Would definitely go back.
MOTOR Bar and Restaurant | Awesome place to eat and have s drink.
MOTOR Bar and Restaurant | It was a truly wonderful experience dining at your establishment. The culinary creations were absolutely delicious and beautifully presented. Furthermore, the attentive and friendly service made the evening even more enjoyable. I must also express my delight in the unique ambiance, particularly the captivating sound of the Harley engines. Thank you for a memorable and satisfying visit.
MOTOR Bar and Restaurant | Excelente lugar, aunque no seas fan de la marca, pasar al bar es darte un descanso, el espacio es amplio, la comida es rica, la cerveza a muy buen precio
MOTOR Bar and Restaurant | Decent service, we had issues with our food but the staff was very helpful and friendly
MOTOR Bar and Restaurant | 1st and last time my husband and I will ever be at this place.
The Wicked Hop | LOVE IT.....
The Wicked Hop | This is a very nice bar and grill located in the third ward area of Milwaukee. It’s very personable, Clean, and has very fast and friendly service. Their french fries are delicious and super crispy and I had probably the best tomato soup I ever had in my life today. Competitive prices. Great place to go for lunch during a workday
The Wicked Hop | Pulled up at 11:35pm on a Sunday where it’s says they don’t close til 2am. Turned away. Get your ish together…we were paying customers!
The Wicked Hop | Best karaoke 🎤 place in the city.
The Wicked Hop | I’m a regular here. My favorite bartender is Andres, truly the best. He’s down-to-earth, incredibly attentive, and always makes you feel welcome. He’s very engaging and he remembers people’s drinks and orders with impressive ease. His customer service is consistently top-notch, and he creates the kind of atmosphere that keeps you coming back.
The Wicked Hop | Food was great! Don't order the donuts. They came out fresh and were hard tasted burnt and couldn't pierce it with a fork. The chicken and waffles were awesome!
The Wicked Hop | Give this boy a RAISE! I just had the BEST Old Fashioned I’ve ever had with Brady! Definitely helps that he was so adorable and gave us incredible service all night! Have been recommending this place just because of him and his amazing service! Love this place so much hoping to see him again <3
The Capital Grille | Made a reservation for my mom's birthday and once arrived was told we would not be able to be seated due to their dress code. Was told the reason was because my mom had on active wear [tennis shoes and socks]. However, we could spot other patrons that were seated with jeans and tennis shoes/casual wear. Host and other staff were rude and suggested we go next door to Kohls to purchase attire that would meet dress code. We drove 40 mins to downtown to have dinner for my mom's birthday. We were truly disappointed and embarrassed. Dress code was never mentioned when booking reservation. I have been to Capital Grille a number of times/locations and never had a issue.
The Capital Grille | What a great evening!  They made our anniversary special.  Food, drinks, and service far exceeded my expectations!  Our server Elizabeth was one of the best I have seen in Milwaukee area.  Personable, knowledgable and seemed like she cared.  Makes a huge difference when there are so many other options in Milwaukee.  Make sure you try the "Doli"!  Signature drink for Capital Grille.... I will be back with out a doubt in the near future.
The Capital Grille | Я приехала из Чикаго на концерт и зашла в этот ресторан на пути в отель. Я не была сильно голодной, поэтому заказала салат и тартар, так же коктейль с маракуйей. Мне все очень понравилось. Весь персонал очень дружелюбный и точно знает, что делает 💗
The Capital Grille | The restaurant was very beautiful, valet service from Amir was excellent. Michael was our server all night he was amazing he had great energy he gave us the best experience ever definitely wants me to return again!
The Capital Grille | We went to the Capital Grille to get dinner before a concert. We had limited time so we called ahead to make sure we could be seated and have a good meal in the time we had. The receptionist greeted us and knew who we were from our call and made all our servers aware that we were on a schedule.  Everyone treated us with a smile and the service was prompt.  The menu was rather traditional with a few daily specials.   I hade a beautiful spinache salad a fabulous filet and we shared a potato side dish.  The meat was cooked to perfection  and the garlic mashed potatoes were great.  We would have loved to stay for dessert but I didn't want to be too full or get sleepy at the show. The decor was old school, a little dark but clean and well kept. I will go back next time I bam in town to try that lobster bisque!
Cavas | We visited Cavas in Milwaukee this past Saturday for my bachelorette party -- 7 of us -- and Chef Ana was absolutely incredible! She not only served an amazing meal, but she was patient, warm and handled our lively group with so much grace and good humor. The entire team was wonderful and made us feel taken care of from start to finish. The food was exceptional, the atmosphere was perfect, and the service was truly top-tier. Highly recommend Cavas and Chef Ana for a wonderful dinner experience.
Cavas | Excellent food. Needs better wine selection. Still, highly recommended! Wear a sweater.
Cavas | Exceptional food, service and ambiance. We felt we were transported out of Milwaukee into a magical culinary land. Ana and Peter made our anniversary celebration so special. We are looking forward to next time.
Cavas | My family and I recently had the pleasure of celebrating with Chef Ana at Cavas. The small, intimate restaurant was fully staffed by her and her husband and the service was personal, warm and attentive at all times. Everything in the seven course Tasting Menu was carefully and skillfully made and representative of the Spanish flavors and cuisine that the menu promises. The restaurant is both pretty and intimate, the expertly prepared food is at different times elegant and bold, but it is the warmth and hospitality that we felt that I believe we will be most reminiscing about in the years to come.
Cavas | My wife and I celebrated our anniversary at CAVAS, and I can honestly say it was one of the most special dining experiences we’ve ever had in Milwaukee. From the moment we walked in, we felt as though we’d been welcomed into the home of an established Spanish or Argentinian chef. Chef Ana and her husband Peter bring such warmth, hospitality, and passion to every detail — it’s clear this is more than just a restaurant, it’s their craft and their home.  The food was nothing short of phenomenal. Each course felt thoughtfully curated, beautifully presented, and bursting with authentic flavor. We’ve dined at many restaurants in the city, but nothing compares to the intimacy and care you feel here. It’s rare to find a place where you can experience both world-class cuisine and the personal touch of the people behind it.  CAVAS is truly a hidden gem — Milwaukee is lucky to have it. If you’re looking for an unforgettable dining experience, whether for a special occasion or simply to treat yourself, I cannot recommend it highly enough.
Cavas | Awesome customer service from Damien!
Cavas | We had an incredible experience dining here! It is a very small, family-owned dining institution and we loved the atmosphere. The server and chef went out of their way to create a great, intentional, and special experience. The food was also incredible!
Twisted Fisherman | This place is a hidden gem. Food was absolutely amazing.We tried several dishes every one of them was A+. There were not many people there and I can't help but think that's because the location is hidden and there's no signage that says it's a restaurant. This was my first time there, and I had no idea as we were pulling in what we were going to do. The bartender was absolutely amazing high energy. Definitely an experience that I will go back for.
Twisted Fisherman | Amazing food, amazing experience, hilarious staff!
Twisted Fisherman | Food was good, staff was very nice. Great experience
Twisted Fisherman | Amazing food and service always. My favorite dish is the seafood pasta. They have parking on both sides - seating indoors and outdoors. The place is such a vibe , and this Christmas the place just looked so cool I had to take photos and leave a review. They currently (mid November) have the outside heated domes set up, just a beautiful and good place to eat!
Twisted Fisherman | Took my wife and young kids out to dinner in the domes (or the bubble as my kids called it), things couldn’t have been better! Vanessa was excellent and so patient with our 4 and 2 year old. My wife had the seafood pasta and I have the pan seared walleye, both amazing. We’ll be booking another dinner in the bubble again soon!
Twisted Fisherman | I Do Not recommend the crab cakes, they have shells in them and they were burnt. When I asked about the burntness, the waitress said that it was blackened! In my book it is BURNED!!! LOl
San Giorgio Pizzeria Napoletana | Love San Giorgio, but really wish they didn't use Styrofoam for their takeout!
San Giorgio Pizzeria Napoletana | Stopped in for a late dinner during a quick work trip and so glad I did! The pizza was absolutely excellent, wait staff were friendly and the ambience was giving cozy Italian bistro.
San Giorgio Pizzeria Napoletana | Last minute decision....what a great little place!  Food was fantastic.
San Giorgio Pizzeria Napoletana | Fantastic Neapolitan pizza, amazing appetizers, wonderful energy in the restaurant, amazing staff. Such a great experience. I urge you to visit this establishment if you haven’t before I promise you will not be disappointed. 11/10
San Giorgio Pizzeria Napoletana | Had dinner for 3 last night and had Jamie as my server. The food and drinks were amazing and Jamie helped us through everything. Was able to give great recommendations and got us what we needed before we even knew we needed it. Would 10/10 recommend the food and the server!
Camino | This spot is a good vibe. We loved that some kitchen work was happening in the bar. We have never seen that before and have an extensive history in working in and visiting restaurants. The food was spectacular my steak melted in my mouth. I have never in my life had Brussel sprouts. I was traumatized at a young age when attempting to cut one in half, and cut my hand. In that moment I decided I didn't like them, until now. So deliciously done. Everything we had was delicious.
Camino | If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Camino | Great food, great beer, great prices, fantastic service. Pay this place a visit!!!
Uncle Wolfie's Breakfast Tavern | Uncle Wolfie’s never disappoints! Be prepared for a long wait (usually around an hour for 2 on a weekend), but it is totally worth it. Service is friendly, vibes are relaxed & I don’t believe there is a bad item on their menu. Pictured are the pannise benedict & brunch burger.
Uncle Wolfie's Breakfast Tavern | The food was perfect — I felt like it was made special for me by my grandma or something. Music was amazing, and the employees were upbeat & friendly. Service was quick and straightforward. Some of the best lemonade I’ve ever had as well. The prices are high but the portions are massive so it’s good to share if you’re not super hungry. All around a fantastic experience!  Also, the song Top Down by Channel Tres came on, and I’ve never heard it in a public establishment before. It’s one of my favorites. Thank you guys!!!!
Uncle Wolfie's Breakfast Tavern | Tasty food! There is usually always a wait for breakfast on the weekend but it never disappoints.  Their Spamelette is the best Omelette I have ever had
Uncle Wolfie's Breakfast Tavern | I had a wonderful experience at uncle Wolfie’s.  The service was impeccable and backed up by very unique and wonderfully prepared dishes. I have been wanting to visit this place for a while. It is in the neighborhood that I used to spend a lot of time in in Milwaukee.  I had the eggs Benedict and it was prepared with a very unique bread I recommend it. I cannot wait to get back and try other items on the menu.
Uncle Wolfie's Breakfast Tavern | Super Carlin Brothers sent me here ❤️
Uncle Wolfie's Breakfast Tavern | I haven’t been here in a while but their breakfast never disappoints. Their potatoes are amazing. The brown butter miso latte was to die for. Service was all around great all of the servers were great.
Uncle Wolfie's Breakfast Tavern | This is my very first review and probably last on google but this place deserves a five stars from Italy, if I could I would give you guys more. The location, the service, the food and let me tell you about their drinks : A M A Z I N G ! The best chai latte I’ve ever had, thank you Andy for mastering the art of being a Barista! and the blend of coffee they use is top quality! The attention of details behind the bar, the cleanliness. The food, from sweet to savoury, is delicious! The pancakes are superb! A place you MUST visit if you go to Milwaukee! You guys apologised to us for waiting 15 minutes to get a table, let me tell you I would wait even longer to come and dine to you again. Thank you for our visit and taking care of us!
The Bridgewater Modern Grill | This has become one of my favorite places to dine in Milwaukee. Staff is very welcoming and friendly. For my birthday dinner, the entire staff signed a card - one of those above and beyond service things!  I find the environment on a nice evening to be one of the best. With the doors open, along the river, and the outdoor lighting I feel like I’m on vacation somewhere. Absolutely love it. Even has a little zone for kids to play on the far end.  Food is great and consistent - highly recommend for an overall great experience!
The Bridgewater Modern Grill | Food and service was superb.
The Bridgewater Modern Grill | Wonderful food, atmosphere and service.  We are already planning our next visit!
The Bridgewater Modern Grill | Fantastic VIBES and incredible food!
The Bridgewater Modern Grill | Delicious food, clean, great atmosphere and tasty drinks.  We will be back!
The Bridgewater Modern Grill | Drinks were small for $15 apiece and the food somewhat bland while still being over salted. In short nice place but the food wasn't worth the high prices
The Bridgewater Modern Grill | The BBQ sauce is to die for! The staff has a youthful energy about them. Warm, friendly, and a lot of smiles. Food is typical American, but it's good. Highly recommend.
Bavette La Boucherie | Was around from out of town and dropped by! Great food , service and atmosphere . Our server was super chill laid back and made all the best suggestions- The big sexy man dropped by our table and gave us a list of places to go to in Milwaukee . (life saver) We now have our night planned out. trying a pizza joint and a punk dive bar. Thanks DADDY 😭😭 South side whiskey sour was a banger 😳
Bavette La Boucherie | Loved our waitress
Bavette La Boucherie | Wonderful, unexpected meal. Wanted to eat light, what I got was that and exploding with flavor in the form of a stuffed pepper salad.
Bavette La Boucherie | Highly recommended for a downtown Milwaukee stop
Bavette La Boucherie | Gem in the city. Delicious food. I had never thought I would enjoy grilled veggies.
Bavette La Boucherie | It was my first time at Bavette and everything was absolutely perfect! The attention to detail, food taste, service and outgoing, attentive staff are what stood out to me most. I had the chicken sandwich with fries and garlic aoli, WiscoPop Old Fashioned, Sangria, and pudding for dessert, and it was all delectable. I'll definitely be back!
Bavette La Boucherie | Great food and outstanding service. Everyone working here was warm and attentive, providing a level of service that is too often missing in dining experiences.
Lupi & Iris | Menu is very Italian inspired. Some dishes lacked salt. The rub on the Lamb was delicious and the cook spot on. Service was top tier, atmosphere was modern and cozy, and the buzz during peak service was great.
Lupi & Iris | I had the seasonal tasting menu, my wife had the lobster ravioli. The food was very good, the atmosphere was quite nice. The service was stellar, our waiter had adequate knowledge of the food preparation and history. Dessert course was the best course of the seasonal tasting menu, and that is not to diminish the other dishes. The flavors, textures, colors, plating, were all perfection when it came to the sorbet. Overall, exactly what I was looking for in a nice birthday dinner.
Lupi & Iris | Lupi and Iris is both fancy and friendly! A rare combination. Add the live music of Anthony Deutsch and the Commercialists and you’ll have a fantastic experience. We enjoy the Charlie Brown Christmas concert every year.
Lupi & Iris | One of our favorite restaurants. Great atmosphere, service. And fantastic food.
Lupi & Iris | Fantastic food and wonderful waiter “Lars” . Our first time here and we will be back!
Lupi & Iris | I was very excited to try Lupi & Iris after reading all about it. Unfortunately our experience did not at all match my excitement.  The restaurant atmosphere was lovely and wait staff seemed friendly and professional. However the kitchen and staff were obviously overmatched for the number of patrons, even though it was only a Monday night. The kitchen was so backed up that for a party of only two we had to wait for our appetizer, and then over 45 minutes more for our entrees of one steak and one sea bass. In fairness, both the waiter and head of house came to apologize for our experience saying there was a large party that had the kitchen backed up, and they brought us...bread..."on the house"...but that was all.  Overall, the experience just wasn't up to par with a restaurant fashioning itself to be fine dining. Portions are limited. Prices of course are quite high. The strain on the kitchen seemed to also affect the flavor as the sea bass was not cooked well and lacked flavor. It just wasn't good enough for what we had to pay.  Unfortunately do not recommend.
Aperitivo | Guys, the chopped cheese is now a regular menu item!
Aperitivo | Mike is a great bartender !  The Happy Hour is to die for!
Aperitivo | Grabbed some sandwiches to go before catching a train. Great food and service. Did not dine in but it was a very pleasant atmosphere.
Aperitivo | Best old fashioned of my life, thanks Bianca !
Aperitivo | Best service, super pleasant waitresses. Best drinks and atmosphere.
Catrina Café Mke | Food was good. Took a bit long to get our food. Drinks were really good! Also, BE ADVISED: I didn’t notice this until afterwards but they charge you to pay by credit card. On the receipt it looks like they’re giving you a discount for paying cash (like most places do) when really they’re charging extra to pay by credit card!
Catrina Café Mke | The breakfast plate I had was the chilaquiles Verdes and it was delicious. They were crunchy and flavorful. The late was also great! It was not too sweet, just right for my taste.  I ate at the bar because i didn't know they had a seating area around the corner and the service was awesome as well. She made recommendations on which plate to get and told me she loved the green chilaquiles and it really was a perfect plate!
Catrina Café Mke | Awesome food.  We were looking for a breakfast place, and found this little restaurant, couldn't been happier from the quality of the food and the great service we got
Catrina Café Mke | Great food and service! Will definitely be back!
Catrina Café Mke | First time here. I had the green chilaquiles with the side of pancakes and the food was excellent. Service was outstanding i kinda of experience a little wait for the food to come out but other than that was great . I tried the catrina coffe it was okay nothing out of the ordinary.  Server was extremely courteous and polite. I recommend this place.
Catrina Café Mke | We had a wonderful time at Catrina Cafe and the food was amazing. We met with Jeny and she was wonderful and so accommodating. Will be coming back for sure.
Catrina Café Mke | The Catrina eggs were so good. Very flavorful carnitas, glad I choose it. Love trying new places while traveling and this one didn't disappoint.
Catrina Café Mke | This place was highly recommended to me by a coworker who raves about the happy hour deals and food and I was very excited to come check it out. I came with my husband at around 6pm on Saturday. As soon as we walked in we were stared at and it was a weird vibe. We shrugged it off and sat at a table and I asked the server about the happy hour deals that my coworker told me about and that I see posted all over the restaurants Facebook. And was told there was no happy hour because the bar was backed up and management was stopping the deal. It’s supposed to be 3-9pm Wednesday-Sunday. And there are no disclaimers anywhere starting the specials might randomly start and stop. The bar was full but we were only the 3rd table in the entire restaurant … so I don’t understand how they were so backed up and unable to honor the specials they advertise. We immediately left. And I will not be recommending to anybody due to false advertising. Don’t promote constantly your great deals if they aren’t valid.
Morel | Very well crafted menu. Sat at the Chef's counter. Nice interaction withe the chefs. Food was very good. Service was excellent.
Morel | My wife and I had a nice meal here. It was a little loud but overall the flavor and customer service was good
Morel | My husband chose Morel for my birthday dinner and it was a wonderful experience! Emily was our server and she brought us complimentary champagne upon learning it was my birthday. The cocktails, entrees (lamb ragout and duck confit), and dessert were delicious; service was excellent. Morel is also farm-to-table, and it is always good to know you are supporting local businesses and farmers. We will definitely be back for our next special occasion.
Morel | Amazing Food, great drinks, awesome staff. Reservations book up quick and there’s a reason for it.
Morel | I could give details, but they are unnecessary, frankly. Everyone here - from the host to the servers to the kitchen and bar staff are better at what they do than I will ever be at anything I choose to do in life. Top notch.
Morel | High quality food in a rustic and relaxed environment. Locally sourced and really consistent. I bring out of town guests often and people always love it
Stella Van Buren | Kelly and Elizabeth were extremely friendly and efficient.
Stella Van Buren | Delightful!! Beautiful space, lovely menu, and wonderful staff. Special thanks to our stupendous server Maigann!! She was incredibly helpful with recommendations and truly knows her way around the menu! Thank you Maigann!
Stella Van Buren | My husband and I shared a delightful breakfast including generously sized frittata, fresh, flavorful berries and savory chicken sausage! Oh YUM! — what a delicious and bright start to our day! Our servers, Loreal and Dalip were very friendly and professional. Outstanding!
Stella Van Buren | We came here early on a Sunday morning, honestly because there wasn't much open.  It was a very pleasant surprise. The food was very good, my husband had the pancakes and I had the American breakfast. We both really liked the smashed potatoes. The prices weren't exorbitant, at least by downtown Milwaukee standards.
Stella Van Buren | We had excellent service for breakfast from our server Dolip and host Kelly.
Stella Van Buren | The food was great and Kelly & Dolir provided excellent service. Highly recommend!
Stella Van Buren | Workers were super professional and patient and worked at a fast pace to help our needs.
La Merenda | We had a party of 5.  We shared small plates.  Everything was delicious.
La Merenda | A place not worth it at all. As soon as we enter we noticed already feel the bad customer service. Not even wanted to try the food if service was awful. A place we will never even try it
La Merenda | So you’re open at 5 and stop serving food at 7 and close at 9? Right. I will take my business to an actual restaurant. Horrible experience here and would recommend you stay away from the rude and stand offish employees. I apologize for entering your establishment prepared to spend money as your bartender wanted to close early at 7. Never return.
La Merenda | The food was absolutely delicious here. We loved how fresh tasting everything was. Our waitress was super welcoming and very nice. It was crowded so you know the food must've been good for all of us people to keep coming back.
Crispy Kitchen | Great service answered the phone very polite and quickly my daughter ordered a pizza puff I ordered catfish fillets and it’s delicious
Crispy Kitchen | A very nice place to eat at
Crispy Kitchen | The food is great the burgers differently the best
Crispy Kitchen | Very great customer service with fresh food
Sanford | Came here for my 30th. Everything was beautiful. The food is so thoughtfully crafted. The attention to detail of the servers was fabulous and coordinated. Seems to be a well oiled machine. My cocktail was perfect, not at all boozy, just delicate flavor! Thank you for making my birthday special and exactly what I needed to begin my next decade. I believe my server was Karisa, she was wonderful! Atmosphere was so lovely and again, the food was an experience I’d do all over again. Wish I could’ve ordered everything!
Sanford | Wanted to have a nice dinner before making the drive to Green Bay and so happy we did! From the moment you walk in, you can tell you’re in a special place. The Staff, the food, and the ambience are all top-notch.
Sanford | We reserved a table at Sanford for the Surprise Tasting Menu with Wine Pairing when our dear friends visited from Colorado.  The evening was absolutely perfect in every way. Such wonderful flavors, ambiance, and gracious service provided by the entire team.  Thank you all for a lovely experience!  We plan to do again!
Sanford | We had a great time at Sanford. The cuisines are delicately prepared and food had great flavor. I appreciate our server double checking on every dish to avoid dairy for my dairy intolerance and chefs finding alternatives. We had $95 4 course and scallops and venison are both great for our entree. Will definitely come back!
Sanford | The food, the service, and the atmosphere were absolutely amazing. It was our first time dining at Sanford and it didn’t disappoint. The atmosphere was elegant, yet comfortable and welcoming all at the same time. We appreciated that it didn’t feel like a stuffy establishment. They did a great job of ensuring we were enjoying our time. We tried the tasting menu, and each and every course was different from the previous, yet it all worked together as a whole so nicely. We’ve been at other establishments where the courses were almost all too similar. This hit the nail on the head. Of course the menu changes, but if the other seasons are anything like the one we had, I’m sure it won’t disappoint.
The Fitz | Great food and great service.  Very fresh food. Reasonably priced drinks
The Fitz | Nice restaurant inside of the beautiful and ornate, art deco Ambassador Inn. I've only tried their food at the bar of Gin Rickey, but will one day sit in their dining room and order more than just appetizers. This is usually the go to before a concert at The Rave/Eagle's Ballroom. The bar is rectangular and when busy, can take a minute for service. The staff have always been very polite despite getting slammed before shows. There's a nice outside seating area as well.  Sometimes you'll run across one of the performers after the show in their patio during the summer.
The Fitz | Great place to grab a bite before a show. We had the coconut shrimp, Cubano, and Caesar chicken wrap.
The Fitz | The server dumped my husband's food down my back before a concert.  That's not the bad part because I understand it was an accident.  The bartender bought us a a beer for that.  My new shirt was completely ruined from ketchup which a free beer did not make up for. Both bartenders totally ignored us after that and we couldn't even get another drink. Had to wait and wait for the bill. I had to eat while my food was warm and my husband had none, then I finished and then my husband finally got his food. Also was a bit creeped out by the bartender trying to clean me up.
The Fitz | Total disaster. No staff! No host, no bussers, one inexperienced server. Mass confusion. People wandering around waiting to be seated. Some sat themselves but no one ever came to their tables, got up and left. We managed to get a cocktail after about 35 minutes, ordered food from the only server, had to cancel all but the appetizer after waiting forever. Was a celebration and needless to say was hugely disapointing. Close the doors and figure it out.
The Fitz | Always love going to the Ambassador Hotel and Gin Rickey’s! Erin was our bartender and server yesterday. A true professional like her makes this place a must do when in the area. Kudos to the entire staff for the warm welcome by all. 😊
The Fitz | Loved it!! Will definitely be returning
The Fitz | We had dinner, and Breakfast at The Fitz. Thy had excellent tasting food! I would recommend to anyone! We will be back again soon! Enjoy!
Lucky Ginger | Spicy Food in Milwaukee? | Intensity over flavor.  Which Milwaukee restaurants have at least one spicy dish on the menu that will make even the strongest among us break a sweat?  I’ve been doing a series since the end of 2023 of ordering the spiciest options I can find, specifically within the city of Milwaukee.  From A-Z, here’s where I’ve gone so far: - China Gourmet (level 5 + chili oil) - EE-Sane (level 25 … off menu limit)* - Emperor of China (hot + spicy … ’make it spicy’ requested) - Hot Dish Pantry (nashville hot fried pork tenderloin sammy) - Immy’s African Cuisine (smoked jerk chicken) - Jack’s American Pub (dragon sauce)** - Lucky Ginger (dragon’s breath) - Lucky Liu’s (szechwan chicken) - Paloma’s (demon s*men) - Pepperpot Jamaican Cuisine (jerk chicken rice bowl and spicy wings) - Pho 414 in Hmong Town (extreme fire with 5 spicy scoops)* - Room Service (level 3) - Sticky Rice (very hot sauce w/ volcano chicken) - Thai A Kitchen (level 4 red curry) - TODD ‘I Believe I Can Fry’ (szechuan spice/dry rub and mango habanero sauce)  There were a few others that weren’t spicy to me, so I didn’t add them to the series.  *Spiciest is a three-way tie between EE-Sane (most think level 10 is the max, off menu they go to level 25), Pho 414 in Hmong Town, and Jack’s American Pub.  **Jack’s American Pub’s dragon sauce wings were the biggest surprise for me, I didn’t expect them to bring the heat.
Onesto | Wicked Popup | My mom's 66th birthday is this weekend and we plan to go see Wicked. I'm looking for something to make the day a bit more special than simply seeing the movie.   Has anyone been to the Wicked Popup? [https://onestomke.com/oz#EventDetails](https://onestomke.com/oz#EventDetails) . Was it worth it for $35/ticket? I'm a bit nervous it's going to just be loud and crowded. We're looking for a good time over a good instagram opportunity.   What about dinner at Onesto? Would you recommend it, especially for a birthday dinner?   Any other suggestions for making a birthday a bit more special with a VERY lose theme of Wicked? 
Twisted Fisherman | Maxwell Anderson Trial in Milwaukee: Day 5 Updates | **Note:** This post is intended to share information from publicly available reporting on the Maxwell Anderson trial in Milwaukee. It is meant to inform and provide space for thoughtful, respectful discussion about the case. Please keep comments civil and sensitive to the nature of the topic and those impacted.  **Content Warning:** This post contains descriptions of violence and graphic forensic details from an ongoing murder trial. Reader discretion is advised. The defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty in a court of law.  *Last Updated: 17:41 p.m. CST — June 01, 2025. This post will continue to be updated throughout the day as new information becomes available.*  **Prosecutors Build Case Foundation in Trial's Opening Week**  During the first week of the trial, prosecutors laid out a detailed and methodical account of Sade Robinson's final day and the discovery of her burned vehicle. Jurors were presented with messages exchanged between Robinson and Maxwell Anderson as they arranged a date in downtown Milwaukee. They reviewed cell phone data tracing Robinson's movements throughout the city and viewed surveillance footage capturing her leaving home, arriving at work, and later departing.  Testimony from police and witnesses described the discovery of Robinson's remains and a broken gate near the location where one of her legs was found. Investigators noted the "smooth" nature of the cuts, suggesting deliberate dismemberment.  On May 29 and 30, the prosecution focused on Robinson's torched car. Jurors saw photographs of scorched belongings found inside the vehicle, including a pair of white sneakers matching the ones she was last seen wearing. Police testified that the driver's seat was positioned for someone significantly taller than Robinson. Surveillance footage showed the vehicle's movements before it was set ablaze, as well as a person—alleged by prosecutors to be Anderson—seen walking away from the scene.  Throughout the week, Anderson's defense team challenged the prosecution's case during cross-examination. They emphasized that there is no direct DNA, forensic evidence, or video footage conclusively linking Anderson to Robinson's death. Defense attorney Anthony Cotton had investigators confirm that the surveillance video does not clearly show who was driving Robinson's car and that there is no footage of the car being left at the site where it was found burned. Cotton also argued that Anderson had no motive.  **Former Tenant of Maxwell Anderson Takes the Stand**  On the fifth day of the trial, June 2, prosecutors called Maxwell Anderson’s former tenant to the stand. The 34-year-old man, whose identity was withheld at the prosecution’s request, previously rented the lower unit of Anderson’s former duplex on Milwaukee’s south side. Anderson lived in the upper unit at the time but has since sold the property.  The tenant testified that he and Anderson had known each other since childhood and socialized during his first year renting the unit. That dynamic shifted after the first year, with their relationship becoming strained.  “I would call him an insufferable landlord,” the tenant said.  He described deteriorating living conditions, particularly in the shared basement where Anderson kept kennels for his two dogs. The tenant said the dogs frequently defecated in the basement, creating a “horrid smelling” environment that eventually forced him to do his laundry elsewhere during his final month in the home.  He lived in the unit for about two years until police swarmed the property in April 2024 as part of their investigation into Sade Robinson’s disappearance.  **Medical Examiner Details Extent of Injuries to Sade Robinson**  Dr. Lauren Decker, assistant medical examiner of Milwaukee County, provided graphic and critical testimony about the condition of Sade Robinson's remains. She stated that Robinson's leg was the first part of her body received by the medical examiner's office in April 2024.  Decker testified that a "sharp instrument" had been used to sever the leg, indicating intentional dismemberment. However, the most striking detail came from her analysis of the femur bone, which had been fractured through blunt force trauma.  She explained the femur—the longest and strongest bone in the human body—requires a significant amount of force to break. In a healthy young adult, such trauma would typically be seen in high-impact incidents, such as accidents.  Her testimony emphasized the violence of the act and added further weight to the prosecution's argument that Robinson's death was both brutal and intentional.  **Toxicology Report Shows No Substances of Abuse in Robinson's System**  Milwaukee County assistant medical examiner Dr. Lauren Decker, who oversaw Sade Robinson's autopsy testified that toxicology tests revealed no presence of alcohol, illegal drugs, or other substances of abuse in Robinson's system. The only substance detected was caffeine.  Decker explained that NMS Laboratories conducted testing on Robinson's leg muscle tissue, while the medical examiner's office also tested fluid from her heart. Both tests screened for hundreds of potential substances.  Although blood is typically the preferred sample for toxicology, Decker said muscle tissue remains a valid alternative—especially when blood is unavailable. At the time of testing, the medical examiner's office was uncertain whether they would ever receive a viable blood sample.  **Tenant Describes Unusual Quiet Night of April 1**  Maxwell Anderson's former tenant, whose identity is being withed at the request of prosecutors, testified that the home was uncharacteristically quiet on the evening of April, 1, 2024—the night prosecutors believe Sade Robinson was killed.  The tenant noted that Anderson was typically loud and active in the house. He frequently had guests over in the early morning hours and often used power tools for woodworking projects. However, on April 1, the tenant said he heard "nothing" which stood out given the usual noise levels.  Later that week, between 5 and 6 a.m. on an unspecified morning before the SWAT team raided the home on April 4, the tenant recalled hearing Anderson moving a heavy object down the stairs. He assumed it was  a suitcase and believed Anderson was preparing to leave town for a few days.  He emphasized that he did not hear any signs of struggle, screams, or the use of loud tools that night. "I assure you if I had heard a power saw being used, I would have woken up immediately," he said, explaining he is a light sleeper.  The tenant also testified that he never noticed anything unusual in the basement during his time living there. He said that while the environment was noisy and chaotic, Anderson was lenient with rent, which he viewed as part of an unspoken exchange.  "It was a trade-off," he said. I knew I was living in a place I didn't want to live in because of how loud and disruptive it was. Max was going to do what Max was going to do."  **Detective Recounts Surveillance and Arrest of Maxwell Anderson**  Just before the trial broke for lunch, Detective John Guillot of the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office took the stand to describe the events leading to the Maxwell Anderson arrest on April 4, 2024.  Guillot testified that he was conducting surveillance on Anderson's vehicle outside Victor's, a nightclub where Anderson worked, around 12:30 p.m. that day. He observed Anderson approaching the car wearing a black jacket, a knit hat, and a backpack. Guillot noted that the backpack appeared different from the one seen in surveillance footage dated April 1.  Detectives followed Anderson as he drove down West Clybourn Street, merged onto I-94 westbound and continued to West Lakefield Drive—just a few blocks from Anderson's then-residence.  "My whole goal at that point was not to let Mr. Anderson get back to his residence," Guillot said.  Officers initiated a traffic stop shortly after and ordered Anderson to exit the vehicle. Guillot stated that Anderson complied and was taken into custody without incident.  The trial is set to resume at 13:45 p.m. when Guillot will continue his testimony.  **Medical Examiner Testifies Robinson was Dismembered Postmortem**  Autopsy photos shown during Dr. Lauren Decker's testimony prompted several courtroom onlookers to wince or leave the gallery, as graphic images of Sade Robinson's severed leg, calf, and torso were displayed.  Dr. Decker Assistant Medical Examiner for Milwaukee County, testified that the right leg was brought to her office on April 2—the same day Robinson was reported missing. She said the cuts on the remains were smooth, indicating the use of a sharp instrument, and noted that a "large amount of force" would have been needed to penetrate the bone.  There was no evidence of natural disease or any medical condition that could explain Robinson's death. Crucially, Decker observed there was no bleeding from the wounds, suggesting that Robinson was already dead when she was dismembered.  "The presence of incised wounds would suggest this was intentional," she said.  As photos of Robinson's torso were displayed, several people in the courtroom exited. The torso was discovered with only the left arm and left breast still attached. Her head and neck have not been recovered—organs that Dr. Decker said would be critical in determining whether Robinson had been strangled.  Due to the condition of the remains, the medical examiner's office has not been able to identify an official cause of death. However, Decker noted that enough cardiac blood was collected from the torso to confirm the presence of caffeine in Robinson's system. No alcohol or drugs were detected.  **Detective: Robinson Planned to Meet Only Anderson on April 1**  Detective Matthew Vandertie of the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office testified that Sade Robinson was not arranging to meet with anyone other than Maxwell Anderson on April 1, 2024—the day prosecutors allege she was killed.  Vandertie said he reviewed Robinson's text messages from March 27 through April 3, 2024. His analysis showed no other conversations in which she planned to meet someone else that day. He also noted that none of the messages during that period were volatile, threatening, or referenced drug use.  The testimony was presented to reinforce the prosecution's timeline and to support their claim that Anderson was the last known person to have plans with Robinson before his disappearance.  **Waukegan Officer Testifies to Discovery of Human Arm on Lake Michigan Shore**  Officer Brooke Tavajian of the Waukegan Police Department testified that she was dispatched to the Lake Michigan shoreline on May, 11, 2024, following a report of a possible human arm found on the beach.  Tavajian said the location was difficult to access, situated far north along the shoreline. She was transported to the site by ATV.  Upon arrival, she observed a decayed and decomposing arm, which appeared discolored—a condition she noted was consistent with prolonged exposure to water. Tavajian told the court she believed the limb washed ashore from the lake.  **Body Cam Footage Shows 'Visibly Shaking' Anderson at Time of Arrest**  Jurors were shown body camera footage capturing the moment Maxwell Anderson was arrested by Milwaukee County Sheriff's detectives on April 4, 2024.  Detective John Gulliot testified that he and a partner were initially en route to Pizza Shuttle, where Sade Robinson worked, to conduct follow-up interviews when they spotted Anderson's black Hyundai Santa Fe parked outside of Victor's nigthclub—Anderson's former workplace in downtown Milwaukee.  "He was visibly shaking," Guillot told the court.  Anderson who was alone in the vehicle, was told he was being detained for a registration violation. Guillot emphasized that detectives did not mention Robinson's dissappearance at the time. Anderson complied with the stop and detectives seized his cellphone and wallet.  The black backpack Anderson had at the time of his arrest did not match the one he was seen carrying in bus surveillance footage taken near the location where Robinson's 2020 Honda was later found burned.  A sheriff's deputy at the scene captured the arrest on body camera, which was shown to the jury.  **Footage Shows Anderson and Robinson on First Date at Twisted Fisherman**  Following a brief break in proceedings, assistant district attorney Ian Vance-Curzan prevented several clips of Ring surveillance footage from Twisted Fisherman, documenting Sade Robinson's first and only date with Maxwell Anderson on April 1, 2024.  The footage showed Anderson arriving at the restaurant around 5:09 p.m. where he chatted with someone at the bar and ordered a beer. Robinson arrived about 10 minutes later, and the two sat together, ordered food, and later interacted with the bartender. At one point, all three took a shot together.  According to prosecutors, the pair had agreed to meet at Twisted Fisherman, located on West Canal Street, at Anderson's suggestion. He reportedly insisted on the location because he needed to retrieve a W-2 form from his prior employment there.  Robinson's family has since filed a lawsuit against Twisted Fisherman, LLC, and Duke's on Water, Inc., alleging negligence for serving alcohol to someone underage. The suit claims that the failture to check Robinson's ID left her vulnerable, impairing her ability to recognize danger or protect herself from harm.  During cross-examination of Detective John Guillot, defense attorney Anthony Cotton asked whether Robinson had been carded at the restaurant. After an objection from the prosecution, Judge Laura Crivello ruled that questions about underage drinking were not relevant to the case.  Surveillance footage indicated that Robinson consumed one drink and one shot, while Anderson had two drinks and one shot during their roughly hour-long stay. When offered a second shot, Robinson declined and the bartender gave it to Anderson. Before leaving, the pair took one final shot with the bartender around 6:20 p.m.  **Day 5 Concludes with Footage of Robinson and Anderson at Duke's on Water**   The fifth day of testimony concluded with prosectuors presenting surveillance footage showing Sade Robinson and Maxwell Anderson at Duke's on Water, the second bar the two visited on April 1, 2024.  Milwaukee Police Detective Jake Puschnig testified that the pair arrived on Water Street around 6:30 p.m. in Robinson's Honda Civic before walking to the bar. Inside, they took two seats at the end of the bar, where they remained for the evening.   Footage showed the two drinking throughout the night, with Anderson appearing to consume more alcohol, including additional shots. At one point, Anderson played a dice game with a nearby patron while Robinson looked on. Later, both participated in a game of beer pong with another couple.  At 8:30 p.m., Anderson stepped outside for a cigarette, according to surveillance video. By 9:03 p.m., he and Robinson were seen walking back toward her car. Footage showed Anderson briefly placing his arm around Robinson. They got into her vehicle a minute later.  Detective Puschnig noted that Robinson did not appear intoxicated or unsteady on her feet in any of the footage.  To close the day, prosecutors presented side-by-side comparisons of Anderson's mugshot, surveillance stills from an MCTS bus camera taken on April 2, and images of a man smoking outside Duke's on the night of April 1. Puschnig testified that all images were Maxwell Anderson.

La Merenda | Restaurants with Kids | Will be in town the next couple days from Madison with our two young kids (3-6 age range). Spouse and I haven't gotten to explore the area much and are struggling to pick where to eat. We will be staying in the Shorewood area but will be going down to Grant Park and coming in by Mitchell Domes. Looking for best recs on where to eat that are appropriate to bring kids but not kid-centric if that makes sense. I've seen recs for AJ Bombers, Kopps, etc. and we'll probably do one of those but also interested in great places adults like. Super fancy romantic, Michelin star type places are probably out but looking for that in-between where we can have great food without an arcade in the background or patrons glaring at us for bringing kids.   If they don't have a kid's menu, that's fine! We like all types of cuisine, nothing too spicy, no dietary restrictions. Some of our faves in Madison are Tipsy Cow, Muramoto, Tornado Room (without kids), Cento/Naples 15, and Mint Mark (would LOVE to try a Milwaukee equivalent of that!).  Especially looking for dinner recs but breakfast/brunch welcome too!   EDIT: Coming back post trip to say thank you for all the fantastic recommendations! For future parents reading this - here is what we ened up doing  3rd St Market Hall on the way in (fast, tasty options, enclosed play pen area right in front of the cheeseburger place). We did sushi and partner did something southern/ribs type. Both good.  Kopps for custard - pretty tasty, both kids claim they still like Culver's better and I have to agree. I think it needed just a bit of salt.  Breakfast at Brewer's Hill Wolfies. Food was good but wait ended up being over an hour (originally to be 30 min) + wait on food mix-up. Had to split up and deal with melting down child elsewhere.   Lunch at Public market - kids devoured a smoothie and ice cream.   Carryout from La Merenda shout out to /u/prelawpup for that one. Fantastic food. Kids at pretty much none of it but we loved it and loved that we could do carryout! My fave was the gnocchi and Kung Pao beef.   Breakfast from The City Market Cafe. Really good coffee, pastries, fast. Egg sandwich was just ok, imo. I wanted to try Seven Swans Creperie but after another meltdown put us late getting out the door, it was a 30 min wait so I'm still very sad we didn't get to try that one.  We went to the Zocalo Food Trucks on the way out and I'd do that again, 100%. Had delicious pizza, tacos, kids had ice cream again. There were several other options I would have loved to try. Nice space for kids to get wiggles out and safely explore.   Still have a bunch of options we'd love to try, plus we need to the beach in temps warmer than 62F, so we'll be back!
Harbor House | Harbor House - parking options for new visitor? | I have a dinner reservation on Monday July 7 at 6pm. Parking in downtown or finding a parking spot can be a headache.  I've not been here before, what are my parking options? Will I be able to park at the restaurant parking lot or will it likely be full on a Monday night? Trying to avoid last minute parking stress, lol. Thanks all.  Edit: Thanks for the tips all, I feel better for next week.
Harbor House | Waterfront restaurant for anniversary? | I’m looking for a nice restaurant on the water for my wedding anniversary next weekend. I’m open to anything within 40 minutes of Milwaukee.

Harbor House | Fine dining restaurants near Marcus center  | Any recommendations for fine dining restaurants that are relatively close to the Marcus center?

Harbor House | New Year's Day Brunch options? | I am looking for a brunch option to take the extended family. Something nice but not Harbor House level nice, a little more cost conscious. It needs to be traditional American food as my MIL is not adventurous, and if it's any kind of buffet it has to be a higher end one as my SIL has concerns about food safety. Prefer the city itself but will go to a close suburb for the right place. Thx!
The Knick | Nail salon that’s an experience.  Also question about good massage spot. | I only get my nails done every 3/4 months or so and I don’t get paint I just get a buff and polish. I’m looking for a salon that is about the experience of going, like you get a glass of wine or sparkling water or soda and sit there for a bit with a book. I’m a dude and I work a physical job so I’m just looking for a good pedicure to keep my feet feeling good.   I also went to the Knick for a deep tissue massage and I was left a little underwhelmed.  I was wondering if anyone has a preferred therapist there or if there’s a recommendation for a better spot. I deal with muscle tension in my shoulder and back so I’m looking for a consistent spot.  Thanks.

Casablanca | Spring elections tomorrow | From twitter: “Folks, there's a Spring Election Primary tomorrow in Wisconsin.  On the ballot statewide is the race for State Superintendent (the Wisconsin Supreme Court race has no primary).

Story Hill BKC | Looking for Story Hill BKC’s Seared Brussel Sprouts recipe | My wife and I were at Story Hill BKC the other night (Love the Place) and had, among other things the Seared Brussel Sprouts, which are to die for!  We asked (begged?) our server for the recipe, but alas, it is a company secret.  He said we could check with Blues Egg to see if we could order them, but for our crowd on Thanksgiving, being able to at least triple the recipe at home would be more efficient.  Anyone have luck duplicating the recipe or have an inside source? (wink-wink)
Story Hill BKC | Story Hill BKC Parking | Have been wanting to try Story Hill BKC but am concerned about parking availability on a Brewers game night. Anyone with experience? What’s the situation - any issues? Not sure what the game day restrictions are either - any risk of getting ticketed?   Happy to walk several blocks if needed, just hoping to have an idea before checking it out. 
Sanford | Fine dining/tasting menu options? | I am planning to stay in Milwaukee for a Saturday night anniversary get away in November. I was looking at the Sanford as an option for dinner, however, I was a little disappointed to find out that the full tasting menu is only available Tuesday-Friday. They still offer a four course menu… is it still worth checking out? Does anyone have other recommendations?
The Edison | The Edison? | My husband was super sweet and thought ahead this year, booking reservations weeks ago at The Edison. It looks good, but I’m seeing most menu items are “coal fired”. I really detest strong smoke flavor in my food, so I’m trying to plan my meal accordingly. Food means a lot to me and I don’t want to be all sour grapes if I order the steak and it’s a smoke show, ya know? So how smoked are these coal fired items? 
The Edison | “What’s one Milwaukee neighborhood that will look completely different in 10 years and why? “ | Saw a similar post in Chicago Reddit and wondering what area of MKE you think will look the most different? Wishful thinking but hoping it’s the third ward after I-794 is taken down! 🤞 Walkers Point will continue to grow and change, connecting to Bay View by the harbor district development. Suspect there will continue to be growth in Deer district and adjacent area with completion of the Edison project. 
The Edison | Milwaukee’s 31-Story ‘Plyscraper’ Will Help Neighborhood Thrive | After five years of careful planning, the day finally arrived—construction has commenced on the Edison, the 31-story mass timber skyscraper that, once constructed, will become the United States’ largest timber building.  “This project is going to bring hundreds and hundreds of new units online and 378 new housing units right in the heart of the city,” said Mayor Cavalier Johnson, who attended the site earlier today. “Now, this matters for a couple of reasons. First, it means more housing. Second, it helps this neighbourhood to grow; it helps Juneau town to grow and thrive because more residents mean more activity.”
The Edison | Mayor to Kickstart 31-Story Timber Skyscraper | Cavalier Johnson—the city’s mayor—announced that he will attend a special ground-breaking ceremony at the Edison next month (a 31-story mass timber building that will become the country’s largest plyscraper) with plans for a second, a 50-story skyscraper, “using as as much wood as possible.”  Using more than 100,000 cubic feet of lumber in its construction, including large volumes of cross-laminated timber panels and glulam beams over an 8-story post-tensioned concrete base, the 378-unit Edison development will tower over the 25-story Ascent, which in 2022 was awarded the world’s largest timber building, using modern methods of construction to build a tower that meets all requirements of the Living Building Challenge 4.0.
The Edison | New 31-Story Timber Skyscraper Breaks Ground in Downtown Milwaukee | The day has finally arrived! After months of delays, construction on The Edison – a 31-story skyscraper set to be North America’s tallest mass timber tower – has finally kicked off in downtown Milwaukee.  Wood Central understands that crews from C.D. Smith Construction and developer Neutral last week commenced preparation works on the build – which will use 100,000 cubic feet of lumber in the cross-laminated timber panels and glulam beams over an 8-story post-tensioned concrete base, with the 378-unit development to tower over the 25-story Ascent – which was in 2022 certified as the world’s tallest timber tower.  
The Edison | Timber in Milwaukee’s Plyscraper Passes World’s First 3-Hour Fire Test | Developers of North America’s tallest “plyscraper” - the Edison - have achieved a major milestone in the push to build skyscrapers out of timber, after they successfully completed the world’s first three-hour fire-resistance test on a mass timber assembly—a breakthrough that paves the way for adoption of cross-laminated timber (CLT) and glulam in high-rise construction.  The test was conducted at the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in San Antonio, Texas, and evaluated the performance of CLT floor decks—supplied by Stora Enso—and glulam beams and columns from WIEHAG. Under fully loaded fire conditions, the assemblies met and, in some cases, exceeded the three-hour threshold required for Type I-A buildings under the International Building Code (IBC)—a classification typically reserved for steel and concrete structures.
The Edison | Why Milwaukee? The Midwest Sparks New Wave of Timber Skyscrapers | Milwaukee is fast gaining a reputation as an ideal city to build skyscrapers out of wood, with work underway on the Edison (a new 31-story mass timber building out of the ground) and plans for a second, a 50-story skyscraper, “which will use as much wood as possible.”  
The Edison | New Tariffs Could Add $4m to Cost of 31-Story Timber Skyscraper | A 31-story mass timber skyscraper, which broke ground in Milwaukee last month, is taking steps to reduce its exposure to Trump’s tariffs, which, once they come into effect, will hit materials entering the United States. That is according to Nate Helbach, founder and CEO of Neutral—the developer of The Edison and a 50-story timber skyscraper on an adjoining site—who said that under a worst-case scenario, tariffs could lead to a $4m increase in costs (or 2.4% across affected trades).
The Edison | Lifetime Fitness Downtown | With all the new developments happening in downtown Milwaukee. The new MATC facility, the Moxy Hotel/Live Nation concert venue, Future Museum, the Edison, Northwestern Unbuilding, i794, Foxtown Brewery, etc. As a former member of Brookfield’s, I can’t but think Milwaukee deserve its own LifeTime Fitness 
Tauro Cocina | Tauro Cocina | This restaurant has barely been mentioned on this sub. It sounds good. Is it good?
Tauro Cocina | Saying goodbye to Milwaukee—what should be on my farewell tour? | Hey everyone! I'm moving away from Milwaukee in about a month and trying to make the most of the time I have left. I’ve lived here for about a year and a half—long enough to hit some of the classics, but I know there’s still a lot I haven’t seen or experienced.  I’m putting together a bucket list of things to do, places to eat, and experiences to have one last time (or for the first time!) before I leave. I’d love to hear your suggestions—hidden gems, classic spots, local traditions, summer must-dos… anything you think captures the spirit of Milwaukee. What shouldn’t I miss?  Some of my favorites so far:   • Summerfest   • Brewers games   • Historical Boat Tour   • Milwaukee Public Market   • 3rd St. Market Hall   • Lakefront Brewery Tour   • Uncle Wolfie’s   • Tauro Cocina   • Momo Mee   • Leon’s Frozen Custard   • Pilcrow Coffee
Oak Barrel Public House | Brunch near Fiserv.forum? Oak Barrel Public House? | We have a Marquette graduation next Saturday at the [Fiserv.forum](http://Fiserv.forum) at 1 pm and would like to do a brunch for 7 beforehand. Somewhere close enough so we can park and walk to brunch and head back when it's time.   I'm eyeing Oak Barrel Public House just blocks away. They claim to have brunch but the menu just lists breakfast food and mimosas. We don't need to drink before the gradualtion so I don't care about that. They have a nice enough looking breakfast menu, though I always thought brunch was kind of a buffet type setup. If it's good I don't really care.   Opinions on this or other ideas please?  
Mediterranean cuisine | Thoughts on Mediterranean Cuisine Milwaukee? Planning a get-together. | Hey! I'm planning a little get-together with some of my high school friends, probably around 8 to 10 of us, and we’re thinking about going to Mediterranean Cuisine in Milwaukee. I haven’t been there myself, so I was wondering if anyone here has tried it and could share their thoughts. Is it a good spot for a group? How’s the food overall? I’ve heard the kebabs and gyro are popular, but I’m open to other suggestions too. We’re mostly looking for a chill place with good food and decent service. Do they have enough space to handle a group that size comfortably? And is it better to go at a certain time to avoid a wait? Any tips or recommendations would be super helpful. Thanks in advance!
Zarletti | Uncle Wolfie's and the Wolf confusion? | Hi Milwaukee humans,   We're going to be in town later this week (with an 8-year-old) and are kind of confused about the 600 N. Broadway location of this place, which calls itself "Uncle Wolfie's and the Wolf"? They both look good, but the Uncle Wolfie's menu seems a lot more accessible for the 8-year-old kid than the Wolf's - and we're not sure if the Wolf is really a kid-friendly kind of place.  Anyway, it's impossible to tell from their website what the deal is with it being two places? Is it Uncle Wolfie's for breakfast and lunch and then the Wolf for dinner, or two places next to each other, or...?  Thanks! (If you've got any other great nearby recs that are kid-friendly, especially for dinner, would love to hear them. Current potentials list in the immediate area is Zarletti, Buckley's, the Swingin' Door.)
Camino | Lunch | Where should my husband I head to lunch today? We are kid free for several hours and we always default to the same places (tiki bar, hungry sumo, Camino) which are all so delish, but want something different. Thanks!!! 🦭🤠
Birch | 40th Birthday in Milwaukee | I love Milwaukee and want to spend my 40th birthday there and introduce some friends to this great city. Was thinking of renting an AirBNB in Walker's Point. Below is the tentative itinerary - let me know if there's anything you would change!   **Friday Lunch:**    **Friday night:** cocktail somewhere (maybe The Mothership?)    **Friday dinner:** 5 O'clock steakhouse (want them to get a supper club experience, but don't want to travel too far)   **Friday night:** someplace to dance to 2000 - 2010s music (suggestions welcome!)    **Saturday brunch:** Uncle Wolfies (we'll drag ourselves up early to get a spot or send someone to put our names on the list)    **Saturday:** bar hopping / college football watching / sightseeing (maybe some place walkable so we could see the beautiful city between bars - open to suggestions here!)    **Saturday night:** Dinner at Birch or any other nicer spot       **Sunday**: Bagels from Ruby's and head home (some of us may try to catch an early NFL game)  
Birch | Birthday dinner | Hi,  Hubby and I will be in Milwaukee for his birthday on May 5th. I am searching for a restaurant that offers a tasting menu. I thought I found one at Birch but they are not open on Mondays.   I have been looking on Open Table and Yelp but I thought I would ask the community for help.   I would prefer to stay close to the Water Street area.   Thank you as always. 
Morel | Restaurant | Parents are flying into town and we are deciding between Goodkind, Morel, & Odd Duck. Anyone prefer one over the other? Never been but all the menus look good. 
The Wicked Hop | Two random Swedes are back home. Thank you Milwaukee! | So. We are back home, jetlagged and happy.  Since you guys truly opened your subreddit, heart and city for us, we thought we'd give you some details about what actually happened to us. Did we get out on the water? Did we enjoy Milwaukee?  We flew in to Chicago and got to our rental car, which happened to be a brand new Jeep Wrangler. We've driven quite a lot in the States but holy cow are you Wisconsinites in a hurry. Driving 10 MPH over the speed limit and we were still always the slowest car on the road. Some butt clenching moments were had.  We had booked an AirBnb and stayed in The Malt House. A really cool apartment house full of Pabst history and Central Waters Brewery and OnTap right outside the door. It was dirt cheap for some reason. We paid about $90 per night for a 2 bed room apartment with all the bells and whistles. We had e few beers and our first Cheese Curds, which we loved, and took an early night.  The next day we walked around Milwaukee and happened to stroll right by BMO Pavilion as The Red Clay Strays did their sound check. It sounded awsome so when we got back to the AirBnb we listned some more as we'd never heard of them before. Took us one song to decide to book tickets.  At the concert we met so many wonderful people. In the row behind us were four of the most fantasic people we've ever met, it took them all about 10 seconds to proclaim "We are going to take care of you guys". And boy did they.. They took us to the Public Market Tikihut after the concert and the evening ended with dancing in The Wicked Hop until it closed. To top an amazing night off, they invited us to Kenosha to go out on the lake with their boat. We accepted without hesitation. Some time later we headed out to Kenosha and had an absolute blast on the waters. Live music, wake surfing, swimming. A day I will remember and cherrish til the day I die. We didn't fish, but we couldn't have cared less. This was way better than fishing.  This is pretty much how our trip carried on. Minus some days with runny noses and a couple of days with shopping.  Everyone thought we were crazy for coming to Milwaukee on vacation. We disagree. We love your city. Everyone was so warm and welcoming. Incredible hospitality. We have only positive things to say about our trip. We have made life long friends. You should feel proud.  Hoping you guys are okay eventhough you've had the rainfall of a century.  Thank you Milwaukee!
Twisted Fisherman | Maxwell Anderson Trial in Milwaukee: Day 8 Updates | **Note:** This post is intended to share information from publicly available reporting on the Maxwell Anderson trial in Milwaukee. It is meant to inform and provide space for thoughtful, respectful discussion about the case. Please keep comments civil and sensitive to the nature of the topic and those impacted.  **Content Warning:** This post contains descriptions of violence and graphic forensic details from an ongoing murder trial. Reader discretion is advised. The defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty in a court of law.  *Last Updated: 17:42 p.m. CST — June 05, 2025. This post will continue to be updated throughout the day as new information becomes available.*  **Anderson’s Ex-Girlfriend Testifies to Secretive Behavior and Emotional Abuse**  On the stand Thursday, Maxwell Anderson’s former girlfriend described him as “emotionally abusive” and “secretive” during their nearly year-long relationship from May 2022 to March 2023. The woman, whose identity was withheld by court order, said she frequently visited Anderson’s home on Milwaukee’s south side and recounted a pattern of controlling behavior.  Much of her testimony focused on a location Anderson once referred to as a “secret beach,” which she later identified as Warnimont Park, the site where the first remains of Sade Robinson were found in April 2024.  While she testified that Anderson never physically harmed her, she described emotional manipulation and referenced an incident in which Anderson got into a fistfight with her former boyfriend on St. Patrick’s Day in 2022.  She also noted unusual features inside Anderson’s home, including “myriad hidden compartments” and a false-bottom drawer beneath the bathroom sink. “He was a pretty secretive person,” she said.  **Detective Confirms Link Between ‘Secret Beach’ and Crime Scene**  Detective John Guillot of the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office testified Wednesday about a key connection uncovered through Anderson’s former girlfriend. Guillot told the jury that after interviewing the woman who testified earlier that day, she led investigators to a secluded stretch of shoreline she and Anderson had visited multiple times during their relationship.  Referred to by Anderson as his “secret beach,” the location turned out to be Warnimont Park—the same area where Sade Robinson’s dismembered leg was discovered in April 2024.  **Texts with Robinson, photos recovered from Anderson’s phone**  Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office Detective Mason Kohlhapp testified about a phone extraction through which he recovered a text conversation between Maxwell Anderson and Sade Robinson, two days before they went on their date the night of Robinson’s disappearance.  Throughout March 30, 31, and April 1, Robinson and Anderson planned their date over text messages, which Kohlhapp read from the stand. The two coordinated to meet at the Twisted Fisherman, which they did around 5:18 p.m. on April 1.  After meeting Robinson that evening, Anderson’s following text to Robinson, recorded in the phone extraction, was at 10:36 a.m. on April 2, the following day, when he asked Robinson about her work. That text, timestamped after Robinson’s car was torched, was the last he sent to her, Kohlhapp stated.  Kohlhapp also spoke about photographs recovered in the phone extraction from late in the night of April 1. The photos appear to show Robinson on a red couch, partially undressed. The detective said he could not determine from the images whether Robinson was alive or conscious when they were taken.   **Judge Allows Limited Testimony After Dispute Over Abuse Allegations**  Tensions flared in the courtroom Wednesday as attorneys for both sides clashed over the scope of testimony allowed regarding Maxwell Anderson’s past behavior in a previous relationship. During testimony from Anderson’s ex-girlfriend, Judge Laura Crivello briefly excused the jury while lawyers debated whether evidence of emotional abuse could be introduced.  The dispute arose after defense attorney Anthony Cotton asked the witness whether Anderson had ever been physically abusive. She answered no. Prosecutors quickly objected, requesting a sidebar and later arguing that the question mischaracterized Anderson’s behavior and violated a prior agreement between both parties to avoid character evidence.  Assistant District Attorney Megan Newport argued that the defense’s question opened the door to further context. She cited three examples that suggested abuse in other forms: the ex-girlfriend’s prior statements to police that Anderson was emotionally abusive, an alleged 2022 bar fight with her ex-boyfriend, and a disturbing instance in which Anderson allegedly told her to “beat herself up” and then claim her ex-boyfriend caused her injuries.  “This was not something the state intended on eliciting,” Newport said, noting the state had stuck to the agreed-upon limits until the defense breached them. Cotton countered that distinguishing physical abuse from emotional abuse was key to his line of questioning and did not imply Anderson had a peaceful character overall.  Judge Crivello sided partially with the prosecution, ruling that the state could question the witness about the bar fight and the “beat herself up” comment—but not about claims of emotional abuse. When the jury returned, the prosecution narrowed its focus and asked only about the 2022 altercation at the bar.  **Forensic Expert: Deleted Photos and  Netflix Activity Followed Date Night**  Digital forensic expert Jason Ruff of the Wisconsin Department of Justice testified Thursday that Maxwell Anderson’s phone data revealed multiple deleted images of Sade Robinson, some of which were referenced earlier in the trial.  According to Ruff, Anderson’s phone showed camera activity between 10:07 and 10:57 p.m. on April 1—the night of his date with Robinson. Just over an hour later, at 12:05 a.m., deletion activity began. Ruff told the jury that 32 images were modified, and by 12:08 a.m., there was no further human interaction with the phone. It later powered down due to a drained battery at 1:35 a.m., and turned back on around 9:20 a.m.  Ruff also revealed that Robinson’s Instagram page appeared to be viewed on Anderson’s phone on April 2 and 3, raising additional questions about his behavior in the days after her disappearance.  On Anderson’s computer, forensic data showed that Netflix was accessed starting at 12:07 a.m. on April 2. At least three episodes of Love, Death, and Robots played, followed by another science fiction series. No computer activity was logged after 12:28 a.m.  Prosecutors concluded their direct examination of Ruff shortly before lunch. The defense is expected to cross-examine him when court resumes at 1:30 p.m.  **Defense Highlights Lack of Suspicious Internet Searches on Anderson’s Devices**  As the defense began its case Wednesday afternoon, they resumed cross-examination of Jason Ruff, the digital forensic investigator who analyzed Maxwell Anderson’s electronics following Sade Robinson’s disappearance.  Ruff, a senior investigator with the Wisconsin Department of Justice’s Division of Criminal Investigation, confirmed that while Anderson’s phone and computer contained deleted images and app activity, there were no search queries for phrases such as “how to dispose of a body,” “how to remove DNA,” or “how to clean up a crime scene.”  This line of questioning appeared to support the defense’s effort to undercut any suggestion of premeditation or post-crime research on Anderson’s part.  Ruff reiterated that a total of 32 deleted cache photos were recovered from Anderson’s phone. He also restated that the phone powered off at 1:30 a.m. on April 2 due to a dead battery—information consistent with earlier testimony.  **Forensic Anthropologist Has History of Cracking Cold Cases**  Forensic anthropologist Jordan Karsten testified on June 5, bringing not only his expert analysis of Sade Robinson’s remains but also a notable track record of helping solve high-profile cold cases in Wisconsin and beyond.  Karsten, a professor at UW-Oshkosh and consultant for the Wisconsin DOJ’s crime lab, has lent his expertise to multiple long-unsolved investigations. Among them was the identification of skeletal remains belonging to a 7-year-old Michigan boy, helping close a 65-year-old cold case in Mequon. He also contributed to resolving the 1983 disappearance of Starkie Swenson, a Neenah man believed to have been murdered.  Karsten’s work extends internationally as well. According to the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, he played a role in identifying the remains of an American soldier who had been missing since World War II’s Normandy campaign.  **Prosecution Rests After Eight Days; Judge Denies Defense Motions**  At 2:30 p.m. on June 5, prosecutors officially rested their case against Maxwell Anderson, concluding eight days of testimony and over 60 witnesses. With the jury dismissed, the defense immediately challenged elements of the state’s charges.  Defense attorneys argued that two of the charges—hiding a corpse and mutilating a corpse—were “multiplicitous,” meaning they penalize the same conduct. Under Wisconsin law, a judge must determine whether the offenses are legally identical and whether the legislature intended for multiple punishments.  Judge Laura Crivello ruled that, at this stage, the charges are not multiplicitous and will both remain. She also denied the defense’s motion for a directed verdict, which would have dismissed the case if the judge found the prosecution’s evidence legally insufficient.  Crivello said that when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, the case warrants proceeding.   **Judge Denies Directed Verdict; Defense Rests Without Calling Witnesses**  Judge Laura Crivello denied defense attorney Anthony Cotton’s request for a directed verdict on June 5, allowing the trial against Maxwell Anderson to proceed toward its conclusion. A directed verdict, as defined by the State Bar of Wisconsin, is when a judge instructs the jury to return a specific verdict based on the evidence presented, typically because one side argues there is no legal basis for conviction.  In this case, Crivello found the state’s evidence sufficient to let the jury decide the outcome.  Following the ruling, Cotton confirmed that the defense would not call any witnesses. With both sides having now rested, the trial will move into its final phase. Jurors are expected to hear closing arguments next, after which they will begin deliberations to determine Anderson’s fate.  **Both Sides Rest; Closing Arguments Next in Anderson Trial**  After seven days of testimony, more than 65 witnesses, and over 300 pieces of evidence, the state officially rested its case against Maxwell Anderson. The trial now moves into its final phase.  Outside the presence of the jury, defense attorney Anthony Cotton renewed his request for a directed verdict. Judge Laura Crivello denied the motion, stating that when viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution—as required by law—the evidence could support a guilty verdict by the jury.  Following the ruling, Cotton announced that the defense would not call any witnesses and formally rested its case.  Closing arguments are expected to begin shortly, with each side allotted 45 minutes to present their final statements before the jury begins deliberations.  **Judge Delivers Final Instructions to Jury Before Closing Arguments**  Circuit Court Judge Laura Crivello delivered final instructions to jurors Thursday morning as the homicide trial of Maxwell Anderson enters its final stage. With both the prosecution and defense set to begin their closing arguments—each allotted 45 minutes—Crivello emphasized the jury’s role and outlined the legal standards they must apply.  Among the key instructions:  	•If jurors are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Anderson committed first-degree intentional homicide, they may still consider the lesser charge of first-degree reckless homicide.  	•A unanimous verdict is required in a criminal trial. If the jury cannot reach one, a hung jury may be declared, and the case could be retried.  	•There is no time limit on deliberations. Jurors may take as long as needed—whether hours or weeks—to reach a decision.  “You jurors are the judges of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence,” Crivello stated, underscoring their responsibility.  She also warned them not to be influenced by any perception of her opinion on the case: “If any member of this jury has an impression of my opinion as to whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty, you should disregard that impression entirely.”  The panel—made up of 12 women and three men—was seated on May 27. Three jurors will be dismissed as alternates following instructions, leaving 12 to deliberate Anderson’s fate.  **In closing argument, Vance-Curzan describes Robinson**  Prosecutor Ian Vance-Curzan echoed his opening statement in his final message to jurors: use "common sense and search for the truth."  He soon turned to Robinson, the 19-year-old victim in the case. The attorney described her as "anything and everything" that someone that age would want to be. She worked two jobs, went to Milwaukee Area Technical College, supported herself and lived in a small studio apartment on the city's east side.  "Most of all, she was respected and loved by her family," Vance-Curzan said. "She was fun, social and clearly anybody who cared about her deeply – until she came into contact with 33-year-old Maxwell Anderson."  **Prosecutor Declares Anderson a ‘Killer’ in Emotionally Charged Closing Argument**  In a powerful and pointed closing argument, Assistant District Attorney Ian Vance-Curzan directly accused Maxwell Anderson of murdering and dismembering 19-year-old Sade Robinson, calling him a “killer” as he gestured toward the defendant in front of the jury.  Using a digital presentation, Vance-Curzan walked jurors through Robinson’s final days, combining surveillance footage, cell phone mapping, and forensic evidence to construct a narrative of premeditated violence. He alleged that Anderson lured Robinson back to his home, killed her, dismembered her body, and then spent the night driving around the city—disposing of her remains and torching her car.  The prosecutor underscored several key pieces of evidence: the deleted images from Anderson’s phone that appear to show Robinson incapacitated; the DNA of both individuals found on a sweater Anderson wore the next day; and the large backpack he was seen carrying—now missing.  As his argument reached its climax, Vance-Curzan didn’t hold back from the horror of the crime. “What kind of person cuts off someone’s head? A killer,” he said. “A killer who’s trying to get away with killing.”  He then pointed directly at Anderson. “There is no question about the person responsible for doing it. The killer—it’s him.”  As he finished, a brief moment of applause broke out from Robinson’s family seated in the gallery, underscoring the emotional weight of the moment.  **Defense Urges Jury to Set Emotions Aside, Argues Lack of Intent to Kill**  In his closing argument, defense attorney Anthony Cotton acknowledged the emotional weight of the case but urged jurors to remain focused on the evidence rather than the emotion surrounding Sade Robinson’s death.  “This is a highly emotionally charged case,” Cotton said. “But I ask you to check your emotions at the door.”  Cotton challenged the prosecution’s narrative, highlighting what he saw as gaps in the state’s case. He emphasized that Maxwell Anderson’s DNA was not found in Robinson’s burned vehicle, nor was Robinson’s DNA discovered in Anderson’s home—both facts he said cast doubt on the allegations.  “The DNA was powerful for us,” Cotton told the jury.  He also asked jurors to consider each charge against Anderson separately and not to assume guilt across the board.  “I didn’t see any evidence of an intent to kill Sade,” Cotton said, reinforcing the defense’s position that the prosecution failed to prove Anderson acted with the level of intent required for a conviction of first-degree intentional homicide.  **In rebuttal, Vance-Curzan criticizes defense's argument**  In a sharp rebuttal following the defense’s closing argument, Assistant District Attorney Ian Vance-Curzan dismantled the idea that Maxwell Anderson’s calm demeanor in the days after Sade Robinson’s disappearance indicated innocence.  After defense attorney Anthony Cotton pointed to Anderson going to work and not changing his routine as evidence of his innocence, Vance-Curzan countered: “He thought he was going to get away with it. That’s the whole point.”  Vance-Curzan also pushed back against the defense’s emphasis on Anderson’s clean shoes, worn the day Robinson’s torched car was found. Rather than proving anything, he argued, they raised more questions—particularly when considered alongside the now-missing “massive backpack” Anderson was seen wearing.  Turning to the defense’s claim that Anderson may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time, Vance-Curzan challenged the jury to consider one critical detail: “Why on earth is he walking around behind an abandoned building?”  **Jury begans deliberations**  Judge Laura Crivello has instructed jurors of the charges to be considered, and deliberations began at about 4:40 p.m.  The jury will decide on several charges, including first-degree intentional homicide or first-degree reckless homicide; mutilating a corpse; and arson.  Crivello said she would have the jury return to court at about 4:57 p.m. and end its session for the day, unless the jury reaches a verdict.

Camino | Restaurant suggestions | Hey!  In town for my job and would like some restaurant suggestions.  I am staying near Butler, but will be all over Milwaukee and surrounding areas   I enjoy all types of food from Italian, Asian, Arab, Indian, etc. So far i had a sawarma spot on the way from the airport and Camino.   Just looking for good vibes and really good food.   Prices preferred $30 max for one person, and the best steakhouse for my last night.   Thanks in advance.

Morel | Need opinions on carnivore steakhouse vs morel | So long story short visiting with my wife and daughter for an event and it just so happens to consincide for my birthday.  Is there a preference between these two restaurants? Anything to know in advance, I'm aware of the price of both. They are in line with what I normally see back home, just want the better quality meal and atmosphere.  Any thoughts?
Morel | Morel sightings? | Hey all! I’ve been on the hunt for the last couple years to find morels while out enjoying nature. But, I have always been eluded. Are they out yet or am I searching in vein? 
Morel | Absolutely not to miss? | After years of driving past Milwaukee, my spouse and I are going to finally stop for a long weekend. We live in Chicago and we'll be in MKE for Labor Day.  So far we booked dinner at Saffron and Morel. We'll be staying at Saint Kate's. I'd love any suggestions for the following:  * Is there a museum we should not miss? (We plan to go to the Art Museum but we are open to switching to something smaller, different, interesting. We are more into modern art but also curious about weird stuff -- from the print museum up in Two Rivers to the National Mustard Museum in Middleton). * Is there a coffee shop that is absolutely a must - in addition to good coffee we are looking for ambiance/preservation vibes: converted church, rehabbed firehouse, restored train station, etc are some of the coffee shops that we loved visiting in our trips. * A neighborhood with some architectural interest? Or with some serious cultural diversity? * A microbrewery. Anything with a citrus hazy IPA would be nice. * An independent bookstore (if there is any left). * Something/anything that you feel compelled to recommend for reasons that we may never comprehend but maybe appreciate when we get there?  TIA.  *This is my first - ever - post on reddit. If I blew any rules, please be kind. It's been a rough week.*
Morel | Monday night anniversary dinner? | My husband and I are celebrating our 9th trip around the sun as legally married people this week Tuesday.   Our kid is at gram and gramps for a few days (no school) so we’re looking to celebrate on Monday night while we don’t have a kid in tow. The problem is, all the good places we would normally hear to are closed on Mondays.  Any recommendations on a place to get a good meal on a Monday night? Places like Ca’Lucchenzo, Braise, or Morel are usually our very rare, “fancy date night” out go to’s for reference.
Stella Van Buren | Stella Van Buren with toddler? | MIL wants to eat at Stella Van Buren on next visit. We have a 2.5 year old, who is used to restaurants and generally well-behaved, but is still, you know, a toddler. He can usually only handle an hour sitting still at a table.  Is bringing a toddler to Stella Van Buren ok, or would we be ruining the evening for everyone else? I honestly don't care, but MIL really wants to make it work. 
Sanford | Milwaukee, where do you actually eat? |   Hi,   We’re four guys who mapped out Milwaukee’s dining scene in an app called Vota. The idea is straightforward: you see two places side by side (Sanford vs AJ Bombers), pick the one you prefer, and the ranking updates instantly. The more people vote, the sharper and more accurate the list becomes. There are still a few duplicates here and there, but we’re cleaning the data nonstop.  I know this can look like self-promotion, and I get that city subreddits get tired of repeat posts, but a bunch of you have already rated places around Milwaukee and the feedback has been surprisingly positive. The usual complaints were “no Android” (fixed now) and “no website” (coming soon). If this annoys you, feel free to ignore me and I won’t post again. No sponsorships, no restaurant deals, nothing commercial. Just locals shaping the ranking.  Here’s the iPhone version, with categories matched to what people actually eat in Milwaukee:   [https://apps.apple.com/app/vota-restaurant-ratings/id6744969212](https://apps.apple.com/app/vota-restaurant-ratings/id6744969212)  And here’s the Android version (finally live):   [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.vota.app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.vota.app)  P.S.: I’m not from Milwaukee (I live in Gothenburg). I don’t collect data, don’t sell anything, and the app doesn’t use AI-generated content. I’m posting in a few subreddits because we now support multiple regions, and I’m hoping for real feedback from people who actually know the area.
The Fitz | New upper east side apartment reaches 100% capacity | "If you build it, they will come." The Fitz apartment complex just reached 100% occupancy, per their IG in less than 11 months. I'm not affiliated just saw it shared on Insta.  Despite pushback against new apartments in Milwaukee, especially on Reddit, this shows that well-located, walkable housing is both needed and in demand.  In my opinion, the Fitz's location is better than the Couture or 333 Water (and obviously smaller in scale), but if walkable amenities can be added to those areas, there's no reason they can't fill up too. The Fitz is also visually appealing and fits the neighborhood well.  I'm hopeful the 7-story project on Stowell near Downer moves forward. Here's to ending NIMBYism and building more walkable neighborhoods in our great city.
The Fitz | Can anyone tell me if these buildings have bug problems? | Hi all, somewhat of a weird question here. I have a massive bug phobia and cannot live somewhere where bugs (roaches, centipedes, spiders, etc) are an issue. I’m heading to Milwaukee next month to search for apartments and so far have the following on my list:  Fortress Easton Apts Yankee Hills Apts Riverplace Lofts City Green Apartments Pritzala Lofts Urbanite Nova Contour Apts  Quin Apartments  The Fitz  Does anyone live in these buildings or has previously and can speak to my question? Or indicate any buildings I should avoid? (Might add a few more to the list). Before anyone comments bugs are inevitable in a city, I can live if I see one or two a year. But anything more than that to me is an insulation and bug treatment problem. Ive lived smack in the middle of Philadelphia for the past 5 years and I have never once seen a bug in my apartment.   TIA :)

Birch | Information for hunters re: missing people this season | Greetings. As hunting season approaches, I am creating missing persons lists so people can help search while hunting.  Despite having only 222 missing adults and 31 children on national databases NamUs and NCMEC for all of Wisconsin, Milwaukee ALONE has [over 500 missing people at any time](https://mediamilwaukee.com/special-projects/missing-in-milwaukee/).  The laws and procedures in Wisconsin do not require reporting missing people to these databases. Therefore, the true epidemic of missing people is misunderstood as even news sources misreport the number.  I do not have access to the full list of missing people – only the police have that. However, these are the reported missing below. They are some of the cold cases – also a few newer ones. These all deserve attention for the sake of the families. I've listed them below, also a link to a page with more information for each. Please keep on the lookout for them as well as evidence of them. I am doing this to help these families get some closure, so please don’t downvote. There are a couple I have left out because of recent developments, but most are here.

Birch | The Bauerhaus  | Looking for information on a restaurant I ate at a few times in the early 80's near Rice Lake. Not positive of the spelling, but I think it's correct. German food, huge wooden structure with a beautiful lake view. It seems it was owned by a famous family, maybe Kodak? It was lovely and I've tried several times to dig up info on what became of it, with no luck. Does anyone remember this place or have any information about it? We stayed in Birchwood and it was fairly close, I believe. Any info is appreciated. 
The Edison | Why Milwaukee? The Midwest Sparks New Wave of Timber Skyscrapers | Milwaukee is fast gaining a reputation as an ideal city to build skyscrapers out of wood, with work underway on the Edison (a new 31-story mass timber building out of the ground) and plans for a second, a 50-story skyscraper, “which will use as much wood as possible.”  
The Edison | New Tariffs Could Add $4m to Cost of 31-Story Timber Skyscraper | A 31-story mass timber skyscraper, which broke ground in Milwaukee last month, is taking steps to reduce its exposure to Trump’s tariffs, which, once they come into effect, will hit materials entering the United States. That is according to Nate Helbach, founder and CEO of Neutral—the developer of The Edison and a 50-story timber skyscraper on an adjoining site—who said that under a worst-case scenario, tariffs could lead to a $4m increase in costs (or 2.4% across affected trades).
The Edison | Milwaukee Mayor to Kickstart 31-Story Skyscraper Built of Wood | Cavalier Johnson—the city’s mayor—announced that he will attend a special ground-breaking ceremony at the Edison next month (a 31-story mass timber building that will become the country’s largest plyscraper) with plans for a second, a 50-story skyscraper, “using as as much wood as possible.”  Using more than 100,000 cubic feet of lumber in its construction, including large volumes of cross-laminated timber panels and glulam beams over an 8-story post-tensioned concrete base, the 378-unit Edison development will tower over the 25-story Ascent, which in 2022 was awarded the world’s largest timber building, using modern methods of construction to build a tower that meets all requirements of the Living Building Challenge 4.0.
The Edison | Milwaukee’s 31-Story ‘Plyscraper’ Will Help Neighborhood Thrive | After five years of careful planning, the day finally arrived—construction has commenced on the Edison, the 31-story mass timber skyscraper that, once constructed, will become the United States’ largest timber building.  “This project is going to bring hundreds and hundreds of new units online and 378 new housing units right in the heart of the city,” said Mayor Cavalier Johnson, who attended the site earlier today. “Now, this matters for a couple of reasons. First, it means more housing. Second, it helps this neighbourhood to grow; it helps Juneau town to grow and thrive because more residents mean more activity.”
Morel | It appears to be morel time in SE Wisconsin | Found today one of my spots. 
Morel | Morels out in NC WI | I've been hiking the woods daily for weeks, foraging ramps, fiddleheads, and pheasant back,  but no sight of morels until today. 
Sanford | Marshfield clinic/Sanford Health new logo. Apparently it took a team 4 days to complete with many trial and error versions... | I think it's safe to say that spending is... mildly going to improve at best? Here's hoping!
Sanford | Need travel advice | Hi everyone! I am in florida and my bf goes to wisconsin every summer for work and I let him take my car because his car is too old for the journey. Anyway, I have to get my car back so I decided on getting a one way rental car from my town in central fl to the Milwaukee Airport. Once I get there though I have to get from the Milwaukee Airport to where my car is in a town called Wisconsin Rapids. What is the cheapest way to get there? Is there a bus, or train or is uber even possible. is anyone from that town going to be at the airport next Tuesday and wants company on the ride home (jk). But if anyone has tips let me know! I had the option to drop the car in a town called wasau but it was 200$ more.  There is also an airport in wasau but flights from either tampa or Orlando are ridiculous. Going to milwaukee seems like the cheapest option. And yeah..my bf could help but he "can't take time off work"  Thanks!!  Edit: thank you everyone! The bus only goes to Steven’s point now for those who need to know in the future. I called them. They must have torn down the bus station..idk.   Edit again for anyone who cares..have a flight from Sanford  airport (about an hour from my house) to Appleton and since it lands at 10pm and is closer my bf will pick me up. Thank you for all the tips!
La Merenda | You could do a couple dishes a person at la Merenda for $50 a person easy
Onesto | Onesto you can get a bottle of wine and two pasta dishes for under 80, under 100 with tip.
Onesto | Haven’t been to the pop up, but onesto is very good. Would make a nice birthday dinner!
La Merenda | I was just there a few weeks ago and I’d say La Merenda is much better tapas.
La Merenda | I disagree, but I love La Merenda too.
La Merenda | I take all my out of towners to La Merenda in Walkers Point. It has a huge menu and large indoor and outdoor dining areas and the food is always incredible
Camino | Not super close to where you will be but Camino's in West allis has a bunch of pinball machines. Also, Reunion Restaurant on Greenfield has a huge game area.
Lupi & Iris | I regularly take my toddler to Colectivo for breakfast or lunch, and Cafe Hollander (or any of the Lowlands restaurants) are also always good for kids. Neither of these is kid-centric in the way you’re talking about, but are still great for kids.   For a fancier place - we gambled and took our two year old with us to Lupi & Iris last week when our childcare fell through last minute and I read that they have high chairs, though no kid’s menu. We figured one of us would leave with her if she couldn’t handle it but thankfully she was great. She had a pasta dish that we sold to her as mac n cheese, and the staff was very gracious about it (and we were working hard to keep her on her best behavior which I think they appreciated). We had a fantastic meal, though I wish we could have enjoyed ourselves more. But if your kids can handle it, that’s an option for more of a fine dining experience!
La Merenda | >  La Merenda  This one looks fantastic, thank you!
Camino | Make sure it’s West Allis Camino. Walkers Point does not have kids menu or coloring.
Harbor House | Harbor House. Patio is amazing

Birch | Birch, EsterEv, and Bacchus each offer tasting menus.  I have not been to EsterEv since they relocated, but the tasting menu experience was excellent at their original spot. Birch is also excellent. Either one would be great. Bacchus is also good, but not as good as these two, imo.
Birch | Birch!!
Sanford | Maybe not at fancy as Sanford but Room Service in Bay View was way up there in terms of quality and presentation.
Birch | birch, ristorante bartolotta, bacchus.
Birch | Based on all the feedback, it seems like Birch is the spot to check out. I booked the chefs counter there.   Thanks the feedback.
Morel | Also Morel
Birch | On open table it mentioned that EsterEv is closed due to water damage, and hopes to reopen in early October.   Booked the chefs counter at Birch for the time being, but might keep an eye out for EsterEv to come back online.
The Edison | Yeah, and what we need is more affordable housing.    Its laughable to Me that people believe that trickle down housing is the answer. "Yeah, so in 2027, maybe a few people will move up from mid price apartments and into the Edison, and those vacancies will trickle down and there will be a few hundred more affordable units in the city. Or maybe it will just be slowly filled by well to do people moving to the city, and other housing will be unaffected. Good luck!"   What we need is affordable housing, anf lots of it. Lots and lots. Thousands of units. Because it isn't just a matter of not enough housing, its that too much of it is priced In a way that many people can't afford and if many others are living very precariously due to rent taking a large proportion of their paychecks and could easily be made homeless by a car accident, illness, or other financial impact. The couture, 333, and the plyscrapee aren't going to change that.    Edit: I'm not saying dont build it. Sure, build it, I dont care, but it is essentially irrelevant to the actual housing demands in Milwaukee. 
The Edison | > with plans for a second, a 50-story skyscraper, “using as as much wood as possible.”  Now this is what I’m eagerly awaiting, to see what becomes of this proposed project. The city entered a year long exclusive negotiating period close to a year ago with developers behind The Edison, so I wonder how that’s going. It might be a pie in the sky proposal unfortunately.
The Edison | Maybe it’s reasonable to be skeptical of the Department of City Development accepting a $700M proposal from a developer that has not delivered a project yet.  The article you linked even states how Bauman was previously vocal in his support of the Edison.
La Merenda | La Merenda is great!
La Merenda | Second la merenda
Camino | McKinley Marina Pier walk with a drink from the Roundhouse Beer Garden.  Kilbourn Reservoir Park, then walk down to Kadish Park and maybe stop for a drink at Lakefront or walk across the marsupial bridge to Eagle Park for their nachos.  National Cafe   Boone & Crockett  Lakeshore State Park by Bublr  Camino then Purple Door for dessert  Koz’s Mini Bowl and taco truck nearby  Guadalajara for lunch and possible mariachi band drop in  Show at Cactus Club after wings at Club G followed by At Random  Foundation before Centro Cafe dinner in their backyard then Bar Centro jazz or see what’s up at Mad Planet or Timbuktu.  North side bar crawl: Warren’s Lounge or Taste for dinner, then darts at Tomato Patch, ending at Club Manhattan for pool or Cherry’s Lounge.  Bay View night: Burnheart’s, Vanguard, Wiggle Room, Blackbird.  Bike to Hubbard and Estabrook beer gardens.  South Shore and Humboldt too.  Close Wolski’s. If you’re nice they’ll give you the sticker without having to close it.  Grant Park Beach  Zócalo Food Truck Park  Swingin’ Door  Bay View Bowl or Landmark Lanes  La Pina for a tequila flight  Walk the Milwaukee River trails between North Avenue and Hampton  Get the chicken sandwich at Thrive on King  Art Bar  Lincoln Warehouse breweries at 1st/Becher and maybe tacos at Jalisco.  Visit 5 Points Art Gallery  Brandy Old Fashioned at Jamo’s
Copper on King | Not a lot of brunch options in that area. Oak Barrel is good. Copper on King has very good food but I haven’t tried their brunch before. They would probably have an opening for you. Reservations are tough this close to graduation so you may need to be willing to compromise on location/vibe.
Mediterranean cuisine | I been in Mediterranean cuisine they are great good portions and tasty food they doing we got combo plate and lamb chops with and red wine. They clean!  I didn’t see any Mediterranean restaurants that clean before!
Mediterranean cuisine | Cosmos Cafe’s decent if you’re going solo and just want some quiet. But they don’t have kebabs, and I’m pretty sure they don’t change the oil for the fries often — every time I eat them, I end up with a stomach ache that night. It also feels a bit cramped in there. I’ve been looking for somewhere more comfy, and a friend actually recommended Mediterranean Cuisine.
Mediterranean cuisine | Lebnani house is good for a date.   Mediterranean Cuisine - nice work lunch/casual dinner.
Blue Star Cafe | Rice And Roll Bistro (Thai, sushi) and Blue Star Cafe (African) offer some of the very best food I've tried in Milwaukee. Both are very different  and offer remarkable flavorful dishes
Story Hill BKC | story hill BKC is phenom. also wolffies!
Birch | birch is beloved!
The Edison | The Eleanor in Greendale   La Finca  SzeChuan  Hen's Deli   HoneyButter in Franklin  The Edison  O'Lydia's   Cute Robot
The Knick | If you’d like lunch to stretch into the happy hour, I’d hit the Knick on Juneau. We absolutely love their chicken sliders and pretty much everything else on the tasting menu they have.
La Merenda | la merenda
La Merenda | Tasting menu on a Monday might be a challenge. If you are okay with tapas/small plates, then La Merenda on the south side of Water/1st street would be a great option
La Merenda | The La Merenda menu looks so interesting. We have done Spanish tapas and I like the choices from around the world. Definitely a contender. Thank you. I would never have found it.
Morel | I cooked at morel for about 2 years. It's fantastic. Everything that can reasonably be made in house, is made in house. With the exception of the hanger steak, almost every morsel in of meat is butchered and processed in by the food who end up doubling as butchers. Highly recommend getting their charcuterie board, rabbit ragout(may be venison or lamb), short rib and round for the kitchen.
Morel | Morel. The waitstaff is the best of the three restaurants, and the cocktails are the best of the three restaurants. All three have great food. All three have good atmospheres. You can’t go wrong with any of them, but Morel gets the nod for me. When taking out of town family, I want someone who is willing to dive deep to discuss the menu and drink options and in my experience I get more of that at Morel than the other two places.
Morel | Morel
Morel | All great (I’ve been to all of these at least 4 times each)  If I were showing off the city Morel is my pick of the three. But you really can’t go wrong at all.
Morel | Another vote for Morel! They have incredible food, drinks and service, every time. Be sure to make a reservation though! If it’s nice they might have the patio open too, which is an absolute vibe!
Morel | Of those three, Morel, hands down.
Morel | All three have rave reviews. I prefer Goodkind; had a couple of the best meals ever there. Odd Duck is very good but I’ve gotten a couple of disappointing small plates. Morel’s cuisine tends to be quite heavy, so if you have people in your party who don’t eat red meat, it can be a challenge. But I don’t think you can go wrong with any of these choices.
Morel | Goodkind and Odd Duck are two of my favorites in the city. It kind of depends on your mood. Odd Duck is mostly small plates for sharing while Goodkind is more traditional entrees. Haven’t been to Morel in ages.
La Merenda | Skip all three go to La Merenda, small plates, 1000 times better than odd duck, if I had to chose from the three I would do good kind.
Blue Star Cafe | Blue Star Cafe on Farwell for unique and truly amazing tasting Somalian food.  It's a no frills place and surprisingly inexpensive. Nice folks too!
Story Hill BKC | sze chuan for Asian. double b's bbq. swingin door. story hill bkc for brunch. arby's on miller park way.
La Merenda | Three brothers (cash only), cafe India (bay view), La Merenda (little bit of everything), Carnevor for steaks (if your company is buying) roomservice (bayview if you can get a reservation)
Morel | If you want steak, Carnivore. If you don’t want steak, Morel. 
Morel | I don’t think you can go wrong - I personally prefer morel. It’s more laid back and I prefer their menu options. But I have had excellent meals at both.
La Merenda | Carnevor, imo, is overrated. I suggest Milwaukee steakhouse.   Whoever said go to la merenda is 100% correct. It will be a feast for all and it never disappoints.
Morel | Morel 100%. One of my favorite restaurants in the city. Their steak is better than Carnevor’s anyway. Been there twice, and each time we had bad service and room temp steak.
Morel | Morel no question
Morel | Really depends on what you want. Morel has great food and a nice atmosphere, but definitely not a steakhouse. Can guarantee you will have an excellent meal at Morel. If you want steak, and these are the two places you're choosing between, then Carnivore. However, if you want one of the best steaks in the city and a unique experience, I would recommend Five O'clock.
La Merenda | Do yourself a favor and go to three brothers or la merenda . Its your birthday after all.
Morel | If you’re looking for steak, I would suggest Carnevor over Morel.  But if you really want the best Milwaukee has to offer I’d suggest 5 o’clock steakhouse or Milwaukee steakhouse.  Completely different vibes compared to Carnevor, but they both do steak really well, and are much more affordable.  You’ll get more bang for your buck at both of those restaurants compared to going to Carnevor.

Morel | Hmm is morels steak just something they aren't known for? What's their speciality?
Morel | Morel isn’t a steak joint at all. It’s new American. Like beef short ribs, lamb, interesting fish.
Morel | Jealous! I’ve only ever found false morels. Enjoy!
Birch | The Colectivo on the lakefront is in the old water pumping station.  Foundation in Riverwest is an incredible Tiki bar if you're into those.  If you have nights with no dinner plans check out Birch.  Lakefront Brewery has a great tour.  The Villa Terrace is a cool old mansion, not a lot of permanent art but the house is beautiful, and it has a fantastic view of the lake.
Morel | I have to recommend Discourse - specifically the Radio Milwaukee building - for amazing coffee. The drinks are all delicious and very creative, plus the building is a great space.   Also, while the weather is still nice I suggest that you help yourselves to one of the city’s many biergartens. I personally like the one in Juneau Park.  If you would like to spend some time outside, checking out Lake Park, Veterans Memorial Park or the marina are all great places to walk and see the lake.  Would also just like to say that Morel is an excellent choice for dinner, that is one of my favorite restaurants here.   Hope you have a fun trip!
Morel | Milwaukee Art Museum on the lake is a good choice! I highly recommend David Barnett Art Gallery, it's my favorite spot in Milwaukee. It's free, just check the times.   I personally think Colectivo has jumped the shark in recent years. Stone Creek Coffee is better. There's also a cute and quirky Fairgrounds Coffee somewhat near the Art Museum, but you have Fairgrounds in Chicago too.   Highly recommend going to the Milwaukee Public Market just to walk through it. If you weren't already going to Saffron/Morel then you should get a panini or burger from Folz Family Restaurant in the MKE Public Market.   Have fun!
Sanford | Get the 7-course Surprise Tasting Menu at Sanford, At Random for drinks, brunch at Wolfie’s and walk around Sanger Garden’s Brewer’s Hill while you wait, Three Brothers another night, there are gorgeous trails by the river you shouldn’t miss — walk or bike the Oak Leaf trail to Estabrook Park beer garden in Shorewood, check out the south shore farmer’s market and walk around Bayview!
Morel | Thank you r/milwaukee !  We had a great long weekend in your fair city, thanks in part to all the suggestions and discussion you offered here. Of course it was impossible to try everything. This was our first trip to MKE but we'll be back.  Saint Kate was a great hotel - with a ProofPizza counter that came handy for a snack. Great pizza. Next time we'll explore something closer to a lively neighborhood -- perhaps an AirBnB -- but for a starting point Saint Kate was excellent and within walking distance from our key points this trip.  MAM is a great museum -- we took a detour on the way there to check the street fair by the Public Market. And got a little bit distracted by the festivities at the Italian Community Center, but we finally made it to the museum. Today we even watched its wings opening up. As much as I love Chicago's sprawling museums, I prefer smaller ones that can be viewed in 3 hours or less. MAM right on the edge there. Best ever? Kohler museum in Sheboygan -- the art place, not the product exhibit next to the factory.  Discourse was an amazing coffee shop. I tried their Channel Orange and Moonwater -- outstanding drinks. And while I was waiting for them I tried a plain espresso just to gauge the basic stuff. Most excellent. MSOE people are so fortunate.  Dinning wise, we loved both our choices: Morel and Saffron. Having dinned at Morel, can I now legitimately claim that I had a meal near with Jeffrey Dahmer had his? Or would that be too insensitive?   The food at Morel was great and the service very friendly. Same for Saffron. We took the river walk to/from both restaurants and it was a marvelous experience.  Maybe I was a bit optimistic with our schedule but we did not have time for microbreweries and bookstores. Next time. But I can tell you that the bar at the ground floor at Saint Kate makes a mean gin martini.  For years, we've been driving through MKE on our way to our property up on Washington Island. I am glad this time we decided to stop for a couple of nights. We'll be back definitely.   Thanks for the tips everyone.  Leo -- OP.  https://preview.redd.it/v7mycew5ylmf1.jpeg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5242df44f2d9f21847527ee6a42edc57c9eabbbb
Morel | I cooked at morel for 2 years. I highly recommend it! Every cut of meat in the restaurant has been hand butchered. The only exception is the hanger steak because it's just a little ridiculous to cut up a cow in a tiny walkers point kitchen.   If the rabbit ragout is on the menu definitely give it a try! That and the lamb carpaccio. Can't miss! And don't forget about Caroline's just down the block if youre into jazz and cocktails.   MAM is a wonderful museum, highly recommend going there and walking around the lakefront afterwards.
Sanford | Can't go wrong at Sanford's imo! Enjoy.
Birch | Birch is one of my absolute favs so I echo that plus everything else
Morel | If you booked at Morel (skip the ham biscuit and go with the mushroom fricassee) grab a beer at Indeed. Good beer and wide range of styles. They also have a great roof top space across the street. Check out one of the county beer gardens, South Shore Terrace, Veteran’s Park and Juneau Park have great city and lake views.
La Merenda | Sorella in Bay View, La Merenda, Le Reve in Tosa
The Edison | The Edison on Broadway
Harbor House | Harbor House has happy hour from 4 to 6 if you want drinks an appetizer and nice views of the lake, then you could have dinner there or go elsewhere - [https://www.bartolottas.com/harbor-house/specials/happy-hour](https://www.bartolottas.com/harbor-house/specials/happy-hour)  Milwaukee Sail Loft isn't fancy, but if the weather is nice you can eat on the patio, then stroll the riverwalk to Purple Door ice cream for dessert.
Stella Van Buren | I would hardly call Stella Van Buren fine dining…
Sanford | Note sure Sanford vs AJ Bombers were the best examples...
The Fitz | is reddit anti new apartments?  the fitz is a decent price point for new construction, its a good building in a good area.
The Fitz | A 1 bed at the Fitz is something like $2200 a month which is more than double the housing budget of a lot of people in this city. I think the pushback is more from people who want AFFORDABLE housing, and less from the aforementioned NIMBYs
The Fitz | Just looked and it’s 1750. That’s market value for a new unit with gym, washer dryer, and brand new appliances. Also looks like they have underground parking for pay. Obviously not cheap but less than what was mentioned and there is a market for it. Now compare that to a building like 333 water in an area of town without a walkable grocery store and lack of outdoor space. I think the fitz is a better deal.
The Fitz | its not totally regardless. I think we are seeing the demand for true high end apartments, such as coture, is dried up so more of those wont help our housing market. But something like the fitz or the new downer building going up are good. things that are nice but not luxury
Morel | Good for Alderman Westmoreland for calling out the community. Unfortunately, the dirtbags strewing trash are not the types to read or watch news, and they do not appreciate having their poor behavior challenged personally.
Morel | I keep hearing about Westmoreland, and everything I hear about him, I like quite a bit. Good on him, glad he’s trying to keep this city the best it can be.
Morel | I drove past police station on Lisbon....tons of trash on their grounds.  Thought "what would Westmoreland say?"
Morel | dude… i can be vehemently against littering *without* being an asshole about it. some people improve with a healthy dose of public shaming, but the vast majority do not. you and westmoreland have more than enough reason to be enraged about the state of your streets, litter is disgusting and unsightly and a symptom of a city that does not care about its image—obviously. no one is pro-littering or saying that people should litter or even implying that litter is okay. i am just pointing out that i think there are better approaches than this, ones that don’t use targeted language. whether or not that is true is irrelevant, because it is just the opinion of one single person living in our city. i’m not out there passing legislation or having say over peoples’ individual actions, i am just someone who is also tired of seeing litter, but who has seen before that passive aggression is largely ineffective in creating change even if it is cathartic. we both want the same thing, even if we disagree on how we get there. again: i am not your enemy.
Morel | you raise a fantastic point. upon further consideration, i never actually disagreed with westmoreland’s messaging at all, i am just uncomfortable with the somewhat racially charged tone of it—but it would be disingenuous of me to pretend that that isn’t a part of the issue, especially when coming from their black alderman. but, that is the area that *he* is representing, and he obviously would know it much better than i. from where i stand, i see litter as more of a symptom of the deeper problem that makes milwaukee such a segregated city, and so im more inclined to want to look at the root cause rather than the details that come as a result of it. i think that black communities need more direct support, less shame, especially about something that’s being treated as a cosmetic issue (let alone the environmental consequences). that’s where my sentiment initially came from. i’m typically very pro-aggressive-action, but i guess it feels a bit different when directed towards my own city. tough love and whatnot. the hostile tone of their initial response didn’t help, though.  you are right though, that if i care, i’ll do more than just advocate for less anger on the internet. i already spend some days de-trashing parts of my neighborhood, but if i actually give a shit i will do more than just that. i do genuinely hope that alderman westmoreland’s message leads to some change of behavior.
Morel | You are reading something that wasn't written.  Alder Westmoreland clearly sees himself as a leader of the people of his neighborhood, many of whom look like him. Those people are (a) fulfilling every stereotype that people outside the city have of them, (b) screwing up the space where he lives, and (c) making him, personally, look like a clown. It would be more embarrassing if he weren't angry.   If you are not a litterer, then this letter is not talking to you no matter what color you are. In fact, if you are a Black person in this city, you should be mad at the litterers, not him. They are making you look bad too.   I understand the urge to be kind, but there comes a time you have to stop wasting time feeling bad for people who flat out DGAF, even if they are struggling. Being in poverty is not directly a sign of general virtue. People in poverty can just suck at humanity, same as anyone else.
Morel | What are areas that one would look to find Morels. Growing in specific dead trees correct?
Morel | These look like real morels, but people need to make sure they don't go picking false morels. Besides being toxic, they may be linked to ALS.    [https://www.thegreatmorel.com/false-morels/](https://www.thegreatmorel.com/false-morels/)
Morel | Morel less ..
Morel | Morel sautéed in steak pan drippings, then used to make a mushroom cream sauce to go on the steak - morel and chanterelle seasons are about the only time I cook steak, just for this reason.
Morel | Eat after cooking, don’t DIY without learning how to distinguish from false morels first (half-frees are fine).
Morel |  Hardly anybody gives up their secret morel hunting grounds.   That said, at my old house they used to come up in the shadow of the neighbor's dead elm tree. They grow on the ground, not on the tree itself
Morel | Fortunately morels are one of the easiest choice edibles to ID and distinguish from toxic lookalikes.
Sanford | Allegiant flies from Sanford to Appleton. Appleton is the midwest hub of Allegiant and their website lists several other cities in Florida they travel to. Rapids has a new Enterprise rental location (715-956-9876). The airfare is super cheap, and you could rent a car for the day and then drop it off in Rapids once you get here. To save money, call the Enterprise location directly to make reservations where you are flying from. Everytime I fly from Appleton to Sanford, I always have to pay extra for my rental car because I booked through Allegiant. Good luck:)
