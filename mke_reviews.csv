This place will always be one of my favorite hidden gems in the city. I’ve been doing more DoorDash lately, so it felt so good to stop in and enjoy brunch in person. The vibe is cozy, the staff is always warm and accommodating with my dietary needs, and the food? A whole vibe.

The Vegan Ultimate Breakfast Sandwich and French Toast were both chef’s kiss 👌🏾, and that mimosa? The perfect birthday touch 🥂💜

If you know, you know... The National Cafe always hits.

Fantastic burgers, and they keep it fairly simple. It’s good food, interesting ambience, and a great place to grab a few cocktails and hang out.

I brought my young son, and he tore into his grilled cheese sandwich, so yes, they’re known for their burgers, but they definitely have other worthwhile options on the menu.

They’re basically a Milwaukee staple at this point. A great spot to start a night out—or finish one.

When we spoke with our server about not enjoying the dish she got incredibly disrespectful including telling us to read the menu (although we did) and that if we didn't ""want"" to pay for the dish that they are hiring (it's not about money it's about ethics).

I recommend this restaurant for anyone celebrating an event or wants to spoil loved ones for a fantastic meal.",,,,"true","0",,"en","Edited a week ago","2025-11-29T04:10:22.664Z",,,,,,,"Dinner",,,,,"$50–100",,"Peanut Butter Pie",,,"Dine in",,,,,,,,,,,"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AMBA38tA_Hn-vd13X9RBrDaZs8qgDx1qkkgP0PiDkV1MvBYtDOfNPIjucTeCz7Q2mGC0x-4evwGisS2LqLPNK9w8GkWaEJdfU-SVi7641UBleADh-CovnEfoAj0MiLpsjoIAaNDIAxiv","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AMBA38sa2zjIcj6mWIh3fNlL6qFNkJOe5BvBZpspcx3oWDYGoy0h4CqVKFhPXHQRYDogzMJQfnF9VEX2FqFyhhMmbQmlZV7ZPgjz0b_7yns1QtFCaLUWXSV2Wmo8trV0BzJ1i6ikXg46iA","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AMBA38uozH0d6-meFtkP_I5YLpEb7vlZNB3c-KOWzFY24LcuTFRg_yRZ8fFgka8Va-Ph9dtzDtRUpQG0UKfrYbFXNVrSphjapbs3SQ9AhOJMjJah9g7PoflJfssHXDn2ALB1pjjMJSWg","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AMBA38t2jfsZsDVS5m5vf-uqnzSAKp76CIvGGWjKyQnvOhcXggiX8cR30eVYLfxmfslQDgv4i1wBWb9yzH41M6JTDPwetfu_9dJkqJLmOlsO4qmcehIpMXOqwAplvLs9ngPoY353c5ECSw","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AMBA38u7-6S4qD4iYtNYOjxxL0oaQyLlKURz2fRiNf_KdVuk1SjVpoaMNZKaaM1PjBIvqjgOEOBu6TN9v87J90sTuh5h5JIcK5B9JTbpSWt8Nmgj2xogJzaUSGlhkuLpnlyb4DC8PZao","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AMBA38vS50rOiF6r3XinXVAf3xDbptIzQnPXxoEXskhkuakZ88_6r4V7NG_MoWh7Unn2HLr7Vl2NL3wtUKA2lzWCglgGWRjKVU1_Jo91HC6fSSKD36KUqH_lUL2nLr-Z2D6ndDk0ei9qEQ","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AMBA38uwMM5U_n7AEs5Ja14rVuqvOGIj_1tVlniVThFBAM6gsZxjbmNJ0mT5mziyFt5zZgQVHbYcJOQA-kTqXpkKR8RWCRXK-qqhC3W0U-NG3J8T0HT34a_HvEHbqdjGoVlFJpFeAkIX","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AMBA38tZhmVTJu_F1gFbHFQ51pQg1BQRxj6y8LXalD4ZzZ6EmwlP9BSzWNjjgBiPQ5zjDKUoZEPxRUCyC3i-pLYVGVGXxJKJBhlHm2o5FCgQDhcg9oaoMGAFW7lnlGU-KJ89hXRzYRiX8A","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AMBA38v2KRGadG2nlRblgN0bi6_s6tlzZwMwpXKLv0Tr--SdVL8XlO-ctPkc1eTtHr-O_ZFqSaR_HIXWlVtgmWelG0anuvw2kfsbtgwfIVTARYovH9lST72jFWzme5NDeH5O6HzK38LCb-KDxco",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Google",,,"13",,,"5","Favorite small plate: Beet Salad

We came here on recommendation from a friend who suggested the burger. We ordered the sourdough bread, onion salad, Diplomac burger, and the trout. All of these dishes were fantastic. The sourdough bread was amazing with the compound butter - definitely try it. You must get the Diplomac. This burger may actually be the best burger I have had. It’s nothing crazy, just a classic burger but done so ridiculously well. The American cheese in every bite was just something else. If you like burgers, you need to try this burger.

Cocktails were great and the beers and wines were also good. Service was great - the bartender took care of the bar whole room, not just the bar. Massively impressive because he was super polite and welcoming alongside that. Ambiance was also just cozy and great for a laid back date night.

TLDR: Definitely recommend and get the burger.

AND PLEASE READ! Amazing. The food..beyond any expectations and lick the plate clean...to the last bite.

HERE IS UPDATED REVIEW..PLEASE BEAWARE:
Have always had a decent time at The Diplomat, until last night. The owners, both of them, are the rudest, condescending, zero customer service skills I have ever seen. My very lengthy YELP review goes into more and after reading a couple of the less than great reviews on here I see this is typical behavior for them. The female owner was rude from the start with aunt. We order small plates but our entrees were taking longer than normal. Bartender went to see what was going on. They missed our ticket completely and would make our food as soon as they could. I asked if something could be done about this and the wait. Apparently you aren't allowed to question thier terrible service. We were give two options. They will pay for our meal so far but we would NOT be served our entrees and we can leave OR they won't pay for anything and we will be served our entrees. It was ridiculous, I questioned why these were our options. The male owner and chef came out by us, yelled, belittled, made a scene in front of everyone. We decided to cut our losses and just finish our fries and leave, which we werent allowed to do. Female owner began taking our plates away mid bites.

They wouldn't let us tip the bartender- said they would, even tho we tried
I was accused of only wanting something for free-NOT THE CASE AT ALL
We were yelled at FOR THEIR MISTAKE YOU FORGOT OUR FOOD!
Got home and immediately reviewed them at almost 10PM I started receiving calls from the Diplomat, which i rejected but they would call back right away. 10pm!?!? This is a very late time to call someone and EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL. No voicemail was left. From another review they must have been calling to yell at me again. Proceed with caution when you visit this establishment as one other other the ego of the chef is out of control. There is a high chance you will be assaulted at the least verbally by the chef. Really hope they do not treat their staff this way also.

To the Diplomat- DO NOT CALL ME AGAIN.",,,,"463","The Diplomat","https://www.thediplomatmke.com/"

The customer service is horrible — they talk to you like you don’t matter and definitely don’t appreciate your business.

What makes it worse is that they overcharge for the items they forget, give no apology, no explanation, and make zero effort to make it right. It’s always just “we forgot,” and that’s it.

From the moment we walked in, the experience was excellent.

We started with cocktails at the bar, and Tyler crafted some truly beautiful drinks. Thoughtful, balanced, and made with care… such a great way to kick off the evening.

Once seated in the dining room, our server was attentive, warm, and lovely. We began with the carpaccio and a fall-harvest style salad (can’t remember the exact name)… both were absolutely delicious.

For mains, we shared three dishes, and I genuinely can’t pick a favorite… they were all outstanding. The prosciutto-wrapped halibut with mushroom risotto was rich and perfectly executed. The roasted squash and broccoli over peanut mole was unique, flavorful, and beautifully plated.

Ordered the fried artichoke, the empanadas and focaccia appetizers, they  were all good. For our entrees we ordered the pork chop, chicken marsala and both my son and daughter ordered the pesto pasta. Pork chop and chicken were cooked well but both pastas dishes were very undercooked (seems to be a common occurrence as other reviews mention). They were not “al dente” but rather had a very starchy, hard to chew inedible texture so we brought it up to our server’s attention after the first bite, both dishes were lukewarm. He took both dishes back to the kitchen returning a minute later with an answer from the chef saying “that’s how they cook it and it is correct” which made for a very awkward moment. He offered to either leave us the dishes that he had taken back to the kitchen or that they could remake them. We asked for them to be remade since they were inedible, bringing the remade dishes about 10 minutes later when we were almost done eating our other entrees. The remade pasta was a little better but it still had a harder chew texture than what you would expect, I wouldn’t be surprised if the same pasta was just reheated, just not a good enjoyable dish. In hindsight offering to try a non pasta dish as an alternative would’ve been a better option if that’s how they serve all their pasta dishes. We didn’t say anything else since my kids were hungry and we were also celebrating my sons birthday, the overall experience had already been awkward. We did order the chocolate and carrots cakes for dessert which were very good. No manager came by at any point to check on the situation afterwards which I found odd for this type of restaurant and price point.",,,,"false","0",,"en","a month ago","2025-10-12T21:58:15.479Z",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"5","5","5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Google",,,"7",,,"5","We had dinner here on a whim on a recent visit to Milwaukee.

Chef Ana and her husband Peter bring such warmth, hospitality, and passion to every detail — it’s clear this is more than just a restaurant, it’s their craft and their home.

The food was nothing short of phenomenal. Each course felt thoughtfully curated, beautifully presented, and bursting with authentic flavor. We’ve dined at many restaurants in the city, but nothing compares to the intimacy and care you feel here. It’s rare to find a place where you can experience both world-class cuisine and the personal touch of the people behind it.

The kitchen was so backed up that for a party of only two we had to wait for our appetizer, and then over 45 minutes more for our entrees of one steak and one sea bass. In fairness, both the waiter and head of house came to apologize for our experience saying there was a large party that had the kitchen backed up, and they brought us...bread...""on the house""...but that was all.

Overall, the experience just wasn't up to par with a restaurant fashioning itself to be fine dining. Portions are limited. Prices of course are quite high. The strain on the kitchen seemed to also affect the flavor as the sea bass was not cooked well and lacked flavor. It just wasn't good enough for what we had to pay.

Unfortunately do not recommend.",,,,"637","Lupi & Iris","http://www.lupiandiris.com/"

I came with my husband at around 6pm on Saturday. As soon as we walked in we were stared at and it was a weird vibe. We shrugged it off and sat at a table and I asked the server about the happy hour deals that my coworker told me about and that I see posted all over the restaurants Facebook. And was told there was no happy hour because the bar was backed up and management was stopping the deal. It’s supposed to be 3-9pm Wednesday-Sunday. And there are no disclaimers anywhere starting the specials might randomly start and stop. The bar was full but we were only the 3rd table in the entire restaurant … so I don’t understand how they were so backed up and unable to honor the specials they advertise. We immediately left. And I will not be recommending to anybody due to false advertising. Don’t promote constantly your great deals if they aren’t valid.",,,,,"Catrina Café Mke","https://www.catrinacafemke.com/"

I’m very sorry to hear about your recent experience. This is certainly not the level of hospitality we hold ourselves to at La Merenda, and it does not reflect who we are or how we want our guests to feel when they walk through our doors.

We take your feedback seriously. We have addressed the situation internally and taken disciplinary action with the employee involved to ensure this does not happen again.

I would truly appreciate the opportunity to speak with you directly so I can learn more about what happened and hopefully make things right. Please feel free to reach me at info@lamerenda125.com
