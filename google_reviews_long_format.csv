This place will always be one of my favorite hidden gems in the city. I’ve been doing more DoorDash lately, so it felt so good to stop in and enjoy brunch in person. The vibe is cozy, the staff is always warm and accommodating with my dietary needs, and the food? A whole vibe.

The Vegan Ultimate Breakfast Sandwich and French Toast were both chef’s kiss 👌🏾, and that mimosa? The perfect birthday touch 🥂💜

Hadn't noticed. It wasn't marked. The other sauce was an upcharge. Not mentioned, didn't know until I saw the check.

Friendly server, but poor service.

46,Elsa's On the Park,"I’ve been visiting this establishment for over 30yrs. It’s been a family tradition the day after Thanksgiving for many years. I was shocked that they didn’t have the peppercorn sauce for the burger Au Poivre, and they only sell chicken sandwiches on select days. But, the worst was the service and the automatic charge of 20%, so the server Faith was not motivated to check to see if we had everything we needed, didn’t try to refill our water glasses, we had to ask someone else to bring ketchup, when we asked for straws, instead of wrapping in a napkin, she brought them loose with her fingers and just plopped them in our water glasses, and when she brought the napkin and utensils, she touched the top that touches our food and goes into our mouth with her fingers.  She never said thank you, and clearly, did not appreciate us as customers.
I rarely write reviews, but this was by far one of the worst experiences I’ve had at Elsa’s or AZ88, which I visit often since I live in Phoenix.",2025-11-29T01:29:22.204Z,google,-0.0106951871657754,neutral
47,Elsa's On the Park,"I’ve been going here for years, and even after all this time, I think the best way to describe Elsa’s is that it’s just its own vibe—part bistro, part lounge.

Fantastic burgers, and they keep it fairly simple. It’s good food, interesting ambience, and a great place to grab a few cocktails and hang out.

I brought my young son, and he tore into his grilled cheese sandwich, so yes, they’re known for their burgers, but they definitely have other worthwhile options on the menu.

They’re basically a Milwaukee staple at this point. A great spot to start a night out—or finish one.

Burger was 9.8 / 10. I could argue that was the best burger I’ve ever had. At $18 it’s definitely the best I’ve had for the price. A bit messy so unless you’re a fast eater it would be a struggle because you don’t want to set it down. I’m here for a good time not a long time though so it works perfect for me.

My bartender’s name was Sam. Nice dude. It was honestly the perfect vibe for a crappy mood. He talked to me when I said something to him. Left me alone when I didn’t. Asked once how my food was.

It’s nothing crazy, just a classic burger but done so ridiculously well. The American cheese in every bite was just something else. If you like burgers, you need to try this burger.

Cocktails were great and the beers and wines were also good. Service was great - the bartender took care of the bar whole room, not just the bar. Massively impressive because he was super polite and welcoming alongside that. Ambiance was also just cozy and great for a laid back date night.

116,The Diplomat,"EDIT!!!! AND PLEASE READ! Amazing. The food..beyond any expectations and lick the plate clean...to the last bite.

HERE IS UPDATED REVIEW..PLEASE BEAWARE:
Have always had a decent time at The Diplomat, until last night. The owners, both of them, are the rudest, condescending, zero customer service skills I have ever seen. My very lengthy YELP review goes into more and after reading a couple of the less than great reviews on here I see this is typical behavior for them. The female owner was rude from the start with aunt. We order small plates but our entrees were taking longer than normal. Bartender went to see what was going on. They missed our ticket completely and would make our food as soon as they could. I asked if something could be done about this and the wait. Apparently you aren't allowed to question thier terrible service. We were give two options. They will pay for our meal so far but we would NOT be served our entrees and we can leave OR they won't pay for anything and we will be served our entrees. It was ridiculous, I questioned why these were our options. The male owner and chef came out by us, yelled, belittled, made a scene in front of everyone. We decided to cut our losses and just finish our fries and leave, which we werent allowed to do. Female owner began taking our plates away mid bites.

They wouldn't let us tip the bartender- said they would, even tho we tried
I was accused of only wanting something for free-NOT THE CASE AT ALL
We were yelled at FOR THEIR MISTAKE YOU FORGOT OUR FOOD!
Got home and immediately reviewed them at almost 10PM I started receiving calls from the Diplomat, which i rejected but they would call back right away. 10pm!?!? This is a very late time to call someone and EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL. No voicemail was left. From another review they must have been calling to yell at me again. Proceed with caution when you visit this establishment as one other other the ego of the chef is out of control. There is a high chance you will be assaulted at the least verbally by the chef. Really hope they do not treat their staff this way also.

The burrata tartine was fresh and flavorful, and the burrata and grilled veggie sandwich was outstanding—perfectly balanced and even better with the side of fries. We finished with the carrot cake, which was incredibly moist and the ideal ending to the meal.

We sat on the top floor, and since it was November, the space was decorated for the holidays. The atmosphere felt magical—cozy, warm, and festive without being over the top. A perfect spot for a seasonal outing or a relaxing bite with great food.",2025-12-01T12:53:30.096Z,google,0.075,neutral

228,Buckley's Restaurant & Bar,"Tried Buckleys with my family tonight based on a recommendation while visiting Milwaukee. Ordered the fried artichoke, the empanadas and focaccia appetizers, they  were all good. For our entrees we ordered the pork chop, chicken marsala and both my son and daughter ordered the pesto pasta. Pork chop and chicken were cooked well but both pastas dishes were very undercooked (seems to be a common occurrence as other reviews mention). They were not “al dente” but rather had a very starchy, hard to chew inedible texture so we brought it up to our server’s attention after the first bite, both dishes were lukewarm. He took both dishes back to the kitchen returning a minute later with an answer from the chef saying “that’s how they cook it and it is correct” which made for a very awkward moment. He offered to either leave us the dishes that he had taken back to the kitchen or that they could remake them. We asked for them to be remade since they were inedible, bringing the remade dishes about 10 minutes later when we were almost done eating our other entrees. The remade pasta was a little better but it still had a harder chew texture than what you would expect, I wouldn’t be surprised if the same pasta was just reheated, just not a good enjoyable dish. In hindsight offering to try a non pasta dish as an alternative would’ve been a better option if that’s how they serve all their pasta dishes. We didn’t say anything else since my kids were hungry and we were also celebrating my sons birthday, the overall experience had already been awkward. We did order the chocolate and carrots cakes for dessert which were very good. No manager came by at any point to check on the situation afterwards which I found odd for this type of restaurant and price point.",2025-10-18T04:11:55.781Z,google,0.003115264797507788,neutral

Chef Ana and her husband Peter bring such warmth, hospitality, and passion to every detail — it’s clear this is more than just a restaurant, it’s their craft and their home.

The food was nothing short of phenomenal. Each course felt thoughtfully curated, beautifully presented, and bursting with authentic flavor. We’ve dined at many restaurants in the city, but nothing compares to the intimacy and care you feel here. It’s rare to find a place where you can experience both world-class cuisine and the personal touch of the people behind it.

304,Lupi & Iris,"I was very excited to try Lupi & Iris after reading all about it. Unfortunately our experience did not at all match my excitement.

The restaurant atmosphere was lovely and wait staff seemed friendly and professional. However the kitchen and staff were obviously overmatched for the number of patrons, even though it was only a Monday night. The kitchen was so backed up that for a party of only two we had to wait for our appetizer, and then over 45 minutes more for our entrees of one steak and one sea bass. In fairness, both the waiter and head of house came to apologize for our experience saying there was a large party that had the kitchen backed up, and they brought us...bread...""on the house""...but that was all.

Overall, the experience just wasn't up to par with a restaurant fashioning itself to be fine dining. Portions are limited. Prices of course are quite high. The strain on the kitchen seemed to also affect the flavor as the sea bass was not cooked well and lacked flavor. It just wasn't good enough for what we had to pay.

Unfortunately do not recommend.",2025-11-13T01:55:50.647Z,google,-0.01020408163265306,neutral

317,Catrina Café Mke,This place was highly recommended to me by a coworker who raves about the happy hour deals and food and I was very excited to come check it out. I came with my husband at around 6pm on Saturday. As soon as we walked in we were stared at and it was a weird vibe. We shrugged it off and sat at a table and I asked the server about the happy hour deals that my coworker told me about and that I see posted all over the restaurants Facebook. And was told there was no happy hour because the bar was backed up and management was stopping the deal. It’s supposed to be 3-9pm Wednesday-Sunday. And there are no disclaimers anywhere starting the specials might randomly start and stop. The bar was full but we were only the 3rd table in the entire restaurant … so I don’t understand how they were so backed up and unable to honor the specials they advertise. We immediately left. And I will not be recommending to anybody due to false advertising. Don’t promote constantly your great deals if they aren’t valid.,2025-11-10T16:14:39.625Z,google,0.005154639175257732,neutral
