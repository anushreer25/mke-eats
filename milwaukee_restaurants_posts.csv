0,1mnsfhk,Spicy Food in Milwaukee?,"Intensity over flavor.

Which Milwaukee restaurants have at least one spicy dish on the menu that will make even the strongest among us break a sweat?

I’ve been doing a series since the end of 2023 of ordering the spiciest options I can find, specifically within the city of Milwaukee.

From A-Z, here’s where I’ve gone so far:
- China Gourmet (level 5 + chili oil)
- EE-Sane (level 25 … off menu limit)*
- Emperor of China (hot + spicy … ’make it spicy’ requested)
- Hot Dish Pantry (nashville hot fried pork tenderloin sammy)
- Immy’s African Cuisine (smoked jerk chicken)
- Jack’s American Pub (dragon sauce)**
- Lucky Ginger (dragon’s breath)
- Lucky Liu’s (szechwan chicken)
- Paloma’s (demon s*men)
- Pepperpot Jamaican Cuisine (jerk chicken rice bowl and spicy wings)
- Pho 414 in Hmong Town (extreme fire with 5 spicy scoops)*
- Room Service (level 3)
- Sticky Rice (very hot sauce w/ volcano chicken)
- Thai A Kitchen (level 4 red curry)
- TODD ‘I Believe I Can Fry’ (szechuan spice/dry rub and mango habanero sauce)

There were a few others that weren’t spicy to me, so I didn’t add them to the series.

*Spiciest is a three-way tie between EE-Sane (most think level 10 is the max, off menu they go to level 25), Pho 414 in Hmong Town, and Jack’s American Pub.

**Jack’s American Pub’s dragon sauce wings were the biggest surprise for me, I didn’t expect them to bring the heat.",Lucky Ginger,37,39,2025-08-11 18:14:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1mnsfhk/spicy_food_in_milwaukee/,milwaukee,-0.00398406374501992,neutral
2,1p7bewc,Wicked Popup,"My mom's 66th birthday is this weekend and we plan to go see Wicked. I'm looking for something to make the day a bit more special than simply seeing the movie. 

Has anyone been to the Wicked Popup? [https://onestomke.com/oz#EventDetails](https://onestomke.com/oz#EventDetails) . Was it worth it for $35/ticket? I'm a bit nervous it's going to just be loud and crowded. We're looking for a good time over a good instagram opportunity. 

What about dinner at Onesto? Would you recommend it, especially for a birthday dinner? 

Any other suggestions for making a birthday a bit more special with a VERY lose theme of Wicked? ",Onesto,5,4,2025-11-26 09:59:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1p7bewc/wicked_popup/,milwaukee,0.02608695652173913,neutral
4,1l1i5ex,Maxwell Anderson Trial in Milwaukee: Day 5 Updates,"**Note:** This post is intended to share information from publicly available reporting on the Maxwell Anderson trial in Milwaukee. It is meant to inform and provide space for thoughtful, respectful discussion about the case. Please keep comments civil and sensitive to the nature of the topic and those impacted.

**Content Warning:** This post contains descriptions of violence and graphic forensic details from an ongoing murder trial. Reader discretion is advised. The defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty in a court of law.

*Last Updated: 17:41 p.m. CST — June 01, 2025. This post will continue to be updated throughout the day as new information becomes available.*

**Prosecutors Build Case Foundation in Trial's Opening Week**

During the first week of the trial, prosecutors laid out a detailed and methodical account of Sade Robinson's final day and the discovery of her burned vehicle. Jurors were presented with messages exchanged between Robinson and Maxwell Anderson as they arranged a date in downtown Milwaukee. They reviewed cell phone data tracing Robinson's movements throughout the city and viewed surveillance footage capturing her leaving home, arriving at work, and later departing.

Testimony from police and witnesses described the discovery of Robinson's remains and a broken gate near the location where one of her legs was found. Investigators noted the ""smooth"" nature of the cuts, suggesting deliberate dismemberment.

On May 29 and 30, the prosecution focused on Robinson's torched car. Jurors saw photographs of scorched belongings found inside the vehicle, including a pair of white sneakers matching the ones she was last seen wearing. Police testified that the driver's seat was positioned for someone significantly taller than Robinson. Surveillance footage showed the vehicle's movements before it was set ablaze, as well as a person—alleged by prosecutors to be Anderson—seen walking away from the scene.

Throughout the week, Anderson's defense team challenged the prosecution's case during cross-examination. They emphasized that there is no direct DNA, forensic evidence, or video footage conclusively linking Anderson to Robinson's death. Defense attorney Anthony Cotton had investigators confirm that the surveillance video does not clearly show who was driving Robinson's car and that there is no footage of the car being left at the site where it was found burned. Cotton also argued that Anderson had no motive.

**Former Tenant of Maxwell Anderson Takes the Stand**

On the fifth day of the trial, June 2, prosecutors called Maxwell Anderson’s former tenant to the stand. The 34-year-old man, whose identity was withheld at the prosecution’s request, previously rented the lower unit of Anderson’s former duplex on Milwaukee’s south side. Anderson lived in the upper unit at the time but has since sold the property.

The tenant testified that he and Anderson had known each other since childhood and socialized during his first year renting the unit. That dynamic shifted after the first year, with their relationship becoming strained.

“I would call him an insufferable landlord,” the tenant said.

He described deteriorating living conditions, particularly in the shared basement where Anderson kept kennels for his two dogs. The tenant said the dogs frequently defecated in the basement, creating a “horrid smelling” environment that eventually forced him to do his laundry elsewhere during his final month in the home.

He lived in the unit for about two years until police swarmed the property in April 2024 as part of their investigation into Sade Robinson’s disappearance.

**Medical Examiner Details Extent of Injuries to Sade Robinson**

Dr. Lauren Decker, assistant medical examiner of Milwaukee County, provided graphic and critical testimony about the condition of Sade Robinson's remains. She stated that Robinson's leg was the first part of her body received by the medical examiner's office in April 2024.

Decker testified that a ""sharp instrument"" had been used to sever the leg, indicating intentional dismemberment. However, the most striking detail came from her analysis of the femur bone, which had been fractured through blunt force trauma.

She explained the femur—the longest and strongest bone in the human body—requires a significant amount of force to break. In a healthy young adult, such trauma would typically be seen in high-impact incidents, such as accidents.

Her testimony emphasized the violence of the act and added further weight to the prosecution's argument that Robinson's death was both brutal and intentional.

**Toxicology Report Shows No Substances of Abuse in Robinson's System**

Milwaukee County assistant medical examiner Dr. Lauren Decker, who oversaw Sade Robinson's autopsy testified that toxicology tests revealed no presence of alcohol, illegal drugs, or other substances of abuse in Robinson's system. The only substance detected was caffeine.

Decker explained that NMS Laboratories conducted testing on Robinson's leg muscle tissue, while the medical examiner's office also tested fluid from her heart. Both tests screened for hundreds of potential substances.

Although blood is typically the preferred sample for toxicology, Decker said muscle tissue remains a valid alternative—especially when blood is unavailable. At the time of testing, the medical examiner's office was uncertain whether they would ever receive a viable blood sample.

**Tenant Describes Unusual Quiet Night of April 1**

Maxwell Anderson's former tenant, whose identity is being withed at the request of prosecutors, testified that the home was uncharacteristically quiet on the evening of April, 1, 2024—the night prosecutors believe Sade Robinson was killed.

The tenant noted that Anderson was typically loud and active in the house. He frequently had guests over in the early morning hours and often used power tools for woodworking projects. However, on April 1, the tenant said he heard ""nothing"" which stood out given the usual noise levels.

Later that week, between 5 and 6 a.m. on an unspecified morning before the SWAT team raided the home on April 4, the tenant recalled hearing Anderson moving a heavy object down the stairs. He assumed it was  a suitcase and believed Anderson was preparing to leave town for a few days.

He emphasized that he did not hear any signs of struggle, screams, or the use of loud tools that night. ""I assure you if I had heard a power saw being used, I would have woken up immediately,"" he said, explaining he is a light sleeper.

The tenant also testified that he never noticed anything unusual in the basement during his time living there. He said that while the environment was noisy and chaotic, Anderson was lenient with rent, which he viewed as part of an unspoken exchange.

""It was a trade-off,"" he said. I knew I was living in a place I didn't want to live in because of how loud and disruptive it was. Max was going to do what Max was going to do.""

**Detective Recounts Surveillance and Arrest of Maxwell Anderson**

Just before the trial broke for lunch, Detective John Guillot of the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office took the stand to describe the events leading to the Maxwell Anderson arrest on April 4, 2024.

Guillot testified that he was conducting surveillance on Anderson's vehicle outside Victor's, a nightclub where Anderson worked, around 12:30 p.m. that day. He observed Anderson approaching the car wearing a black jacket, a knit hat, and a backpack. Guillot noted that the backpack appeared different from the one seen in surveillance footage dated April 1.

Detectives followed Anderson as he drove down West Clybourn Street, merged onto I-94 westbound and continued to West Lakefield Drive—just a few blocks from Anderson's then-residence.

""My whole goal at that point was not to let Mr. Anderson get back to his residence,"" Guillot said.

Officers initiated a traffic stop shortly after and ordered Anderson to exit the vehicle. Guillot stated that Anderson complied and was taken into custody without incident.

The trial is set to resume at 13:45 p.m. when Guillot will continue his testimony.

**Medical Examiner Testifies Robinson was Dismembered Postmortem**

Autopsy photos shown during Dr. Lauren Decker's testimony prompted several courtroom onlookers to wince or leave the gallery, as graphic images of Sade Robinson's severed leg, calf, and torso were displayed.

Dr. Decker Assistant Medical Examiner for Milwaukee County, testified that the right leg was brought to her office on April 2—the same day Robinson was reported missing. She said the cuts on the remains were smooth, indicating the use of a sharp instrument, and noted that a ""large amount of force"" would have been needed to penetrate the bone.

There was no evidence of natural disease or any medical condition that could explain Robinson's death. Crucially, Decker observed there was no bleeding from the wounds, suggesting that Robinson was already dead when she was dismembered.

""The presence of incised wounds would suggest this was intentional,"" she said.

As photos of Robinson's torso were displayed, several people in the courtroom exited. The torso was discovered with only the left arm and left breast still attached. Her head and neck have not been recovered—organs that Dr. Decker said would be critical in determining whether Robinson had been strangled.

Due to the condition of the remains, the medical examiner's office has not been able to identify an official cause of death. However, Decker noted that enough cardiac blood was collected from the torso to confirm the presence of caffeine in Robinson's system. No alcohol or drugs were detected.

**Detective: Robinson Planned to Meet Only Anderson on April 1**

Detective Matthew Vandertie of the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office testified that Sade Robinson was not arranging to meet with anyone other than Maxwell Anderson on April 1, 2024—the day prosecutors allege she was killed.

Vandertie said he reviewed Robinson's text messages from March 27 through April 3, 2024. His analysis showed no other conversations in which she planned to meet someone else that day. He also noted that none of the messages during that period were volatile, threatening, or referenced drug use.

The testimony was presented to reinforce the prosecution's timeline and to support their claim that Anderson was the last known person to have plans with Robinson before his disappearance.

**Waukegan Officer Testifies to Discovery of Human Arm on Lake Michigan Shore**

Officer Brooke Tavajian of the Waukegan Police Department testified that she was dispatched to the Lake Michigan shoreline on May, 11, 2024, following a report of a possible human arm found on the beach.

Tavajian said the location was difficult to access, situated far north along the shoreline. She was transported to the site by ATV.

Upon arrival, she observed a decayed and decomposing arm, which appeared discolored—a condition she noted was consistent with prolonged exposure to water. Tavajian told the court she believed the limb washed ashore from the lake.

**Body Cam Footage Shows 'Visibly Shaking' Anderson at Time of Arrest**

Jurors were shown body camera footage capturing the moment Maxwell Anderson was arrested by Milwaukee County Sheriff's detectives on April 4, 2024.

Detective John Gulliot testified that he and a partner were initially en route to Pizza Shuttle, where Sade Robinson worked, to conduct follow-up interviews when they spotted Anderson's black Hyundai Santa Fe parked outside of Victor's nigthclub—Anderson's former workplace in downtown Milwaukee.

""He was visibly shaking,"" Guillot told the court.

Anderson who was alone in the vehicle, was told he was being detained for a registration violation. Guillot emphasized that detectives did not mention Robinson's dissappearance at the time. Anderson complied with the stop and detectives seized his cellphone and wallet.

The black backpack Anderson had at the time of his arrest did not match the one he was seen carrying in bus surveillance footage taken near the location where Robinson's 2020 Honda was later found burned.

A sheriff's deputy at the scene captured the arrest on body camera, which was shown to the jury.

**Footage Shows Anderson and Robinson on First Date at Twisted Fisherman**

Following a brief break in proceedings, assistant district attorney Ian Vance-Curzan prevented several clips of Ring surveillance footage from Twisted Fisherman, documenting Sade Robinson's first and only date with Maxwell Anderson on April 1, 2024.

The footage showed Anderson arriving at the restaurant around 5:09 p.m. where he chatted with someone at the bar and ordered a beer. Robinson arrived about 10 minutes later, and the two sat together, ordered food, and later interacted with the bartender. At one point, all three took a shot together.

According to prosecutors, the pair had agreed to meet at Twisted Fisherman, located on West Canal Street, at Anderson's suggestion. He reportedly insisted on the location because he needed to retrieve a W-2 form from his prior employment there.

Robinson's family has since filed a lawsuit against Twisted Fisherman, LLC, and Duke's on Water, Inc., alleging negligence for serving alcohol to someone underage. The suit claims that the failture to check Robinson's ID left her vulnerable, impairing her ability to recognize danger or protect herself from harm.

During cross-examination of Detective John Guillot, defense attorney Anthony Cotton asked whether Robinson had been carded at the restaurant. After an objection from the prosecution, Judge Laura Crivello ruled that questions about underage drinking were not relevant to the case.

Surveillance footage indicated that Robinson consumed one drink and one shot, while Anderson had two drinks and one shot during their roughly hour-long stay. When offered a second shot, Robinson declined and the bartender gave it to Anderson. Before leaving, the pair took one final shot with the bartender around 6:20 p.m.

**Day 5 Concludes with Footage of Robinson and Anderson at Duke's on Water** 

The fifth day of testimony concluded with prosectuors presenting surveillance footage showing Sade Robinson and Maxwell Anderson at Duke's on Water, the second bar the two visited on April 1, 2024.

Milwaukee Police Detective Jake Puschnig testified that the pair arrived on Water Street around 6:30 p.m. in Robinson's Honda Civic before walking to the bar. Inside, they took two seats at the end of the bar, where they remained for the evening. 

Footage showed the two drinking throughout the night, with Anderson appearing to consume more alcohol, including additional shots. At one point, Anderson played a dice game with a nearby patron while Robinson looked on. Later, both participated in a game of beer pong with another couple.

At 8:30 p.m., Anderson stepped outside for a cigarette, according to surveillance video. By 9:03 p.m., he and Robinson were seen walking back toward her car. Footage showed Anderson briefly placing his arm around Robinson. They got into her vehicle a minute later.

Detective Puschnig noted that Robinson did not appear intoxicated or unsteady on her feet in any of the footage.

To close the day, prosecutors presented side-by-side comparisons of Anderson's mugshot, surveillance stills from an MCTS bus camera taken on April 2, and images of a man smoking outside Duke's on the night of April 1. Puschnig testified that all images were Maxwell Anderson.",Twisted Fisherman,40,50,2025-06-02 08:33:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1l1i5ex/maxwell_anderson_trial_in_milwaukee_day_5_updates/,milwaukee,-0.0003935458480913026,neutral

6,1ks0loy,Restaurants with Kids,"Will be in town the next couple days from Madison with our two young kids (3-6 age range). Spouse and I haven't gotten to explore the area much and are struggling to pick where to eat. We will be staying in the Shorewood area but will be going down to Grant Park and coming in by Mitchell Domes. Looking for best recs on where to eat that are appropriate to bring kids but not kid-centric if that makes sense. I've seen recs for AJ Bombers, Kopps, etc. and we'll probably do one of those but also interested in great places adults like. Super fancy romantic, Michelin star type places are probably out but looking for that in-between where we can have great food without an arcade in the background or patrons glaring at us for bringing kids.

 If they don't have a kid's menu, that's fine! We like all types of cuisine, nothing too spicy, no dietary restrictions. Some of our faves in Madison are Tipsy Cow, Muramoto, Tornado Room (without kids), Cento/Naples 15, and Mint Mark (would LOVE to try a Milwaukee equivalent of that!).  Especially looking for dinner recs but breakfast/brunch welcome too!


EDIT: Coming back post trip to say thank you for all the fantastic recommendations! For future parents reading this - here is what we ened up doing

3rd St Market Hall on the way in (fast, tasty options, enclosed play pen area right in front of the cheeseburger place). We did sushi and partner did something southern/ribs type. Both good.

Kopps for custard - pretty tasty, both kids claim they still like Culver's better and I have to agree. I think it needed just a bit of salt.

Breakfast at Brewer's Hill Wolfies. Food was good but wait ended up being over an hour (originally to be 30 min) + wait on food mix-up. Had to split up and deal with melting down child elsewhere. 

Lunch at Public market - kids devoured a smoothie and ice cream. 

Carryout from La Merenda shout out to /u/prelawpup for that one. Fantastic food. Kids at pretty much none of it but we loved it and loved that we could do carryout! My fave was the gnocchi and Kung Pao beef. 

Breakfast from The City Market Cafe. Really good coffee, pastries, fast. Egg sandwich was just ok, imo. I wanted to try Seven Swans Creperie but after another meltdown put us late getting out the door, it was a 30 min wait so I'm still very sad we didn't get to try that one.

We went to the Zocalo Food Trucks on the way out and I'd do that again, 100%. Had delicious pizza, tacos, kids had ice cream again. There were several other options I would have loved to try. Nice space for kids to get wiggles out and safely explore. 

Still have a bunch of options we'd love to try, plus we need to the beach in temps warmer than 62F, so we'll be back!",La Merenda,0,45,2025-05-21 10:24:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1ks0loy/restaurants_with_kids/,milwaukee,0.02233009708737864,neutral

40,1mmv9sq,Two random Swedes are back home. Thank you Milwaukee!,"So. We are back home, jetlagged and happy.

Since you guys truly opened your subreddit, heart and city for us, we thought we'd give you some details about what actually happened to us. Did we get out on the water? Did we enjoy Milwaukee?

We flew in to Chicago and got to our rental car, which happened to be a brand new Jeep Wrangler. We've driven quite a lot in the States but holy cow are you Wisconsinites in a hurry. Driving 10 MPH over the speed limit and we were still always the slowest car on the road. Some butt clenching moments were had.

We had booked an AirBnb and stayed in The Malt House. A really cool apartment house full of Pabst history and Central Waters Brewery and OnTap right outside the door. It was dirt cheap for some reason. We paid about $90 per night for a 2 bed room apartment with all the bells and whistles. We had e few beers and our first Cheese Curds, which we loved, and took an early night.

The next day we walked around Milwaukee and happened to stroll right by BMO Pavilion as The Red Clay Strays did their sound check. It sounded awsome so when we got back to the AirBnb we listned some more as we'd never heard of them before. Took us one song to decide to book tickets.

At the concert we met so many wonderful people. In the row behind us were four of the most fantasic people we've ever met, it took them all about 10 seconds to proclaim ""We are going to take care of you guys"". And boy did they.. They took us to the Public Market Tikihut after the concert and the evening ended with dancing in The Wicked Hop until it closed. To top an amazing night off, they invited us to Kenosha to go out on the lake with their boat. We accepted without hesitation. Some time later we headed out to Kenosha and had an absolute blast on the waters. Live music, wake surfing, swimming. A day I will remember and cherrish til the day I die. We didn't fish, but we couldn't have cared less. This was way better than fishing.

This is pretty much how our trip carried on. Minus some days with runny noses and a couple of days with shopping.

Everyone thought we were crazy for coming to Milwaukee on vacation. We disagree. We love your city. Everyone was so warm and welcoming. Incredible hospitality. We have only positive things to say about our trip. We have made life long friends. You should feel proud.

Hoping you guys are okay eventhough you've had the rainfall of a century.

**Anderson’s Ex-Girlfriend Testifies to Secretive Behavior and Emotional Abuse**

On the stand Thursday, Maxwell Anderson’s former girlfriend described him as “emotionally abusive” and “secretive” during their nearly year-long relationship from May 2022 to March 2023. The woman, whose identity was withheld by court order, said she frequently visited Anderson’s home on Milwaukee’s south side and recounted a pattern of controlling behavior.

Much of her testimony focused on a location Anderson once referred to as a “secret beach,” which she later identified as Warnimont Park, the site where the first remains of Sade Robinson were found in April 2024.

While she testified that Anderson never physically harmed her, she described emotional manipulation and referenced an incident in which Anderson got into a fistfight with her former boyfriend on St. Patrick’s Day in 2022.

She also noted unusual features inside Anderson’s home, including “myriad hidden compartments” and a false-bottom drawer beneath the bathroom sink. “He was a pretty secretive person,” she said.

**Detective Confirms Link Between ‘Secret Beach’ and Crime Scene**

Detective John Guillot of the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office testified Wednesday about a key connection uncovered through Anderson’s former girlfriend. Guillot told the jury that after interviewing the woman who testified earlier that day, she led investigators to a secluded stretch of shoreline she and Anderson had visited multiple times during their relationship.

Referred to by Anderson as his “secret beach,” the location turned out to be Warnimont Park—the same area where Sade Robinson’s dismembered leg was discovered in April 2024.

**Texts with Robinson, photos recovered from Anderson’s phone**

Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office Detective Mason Kohlhapp testified about a phone extraction through which he recovered a text conversation between Maxwell Anderson and Sade Robinson, two days before they went on their date the night of Robinson’s disappearance.

Throughout March 30, 31, and April 1, Robinson and Anderson planned their date over text messages, which Kohlhapp read from the stand. The two coordinated to meet at the Twisted Fisherman, which they did around 5:18 p.m. on April 1.

After meeting Robinson that evening, Anderson’s following text to Robinson, recorded in the phone extraction, was at 10:36 a.m. on April 2, the following day, when he asked Robinson about her work. That text, timestamped after Robinson’s car was torched, was the last he sent to her, Kohlhapp stated.

Kohlhapp also spoke about photographs recovered in the phone extraction from late in the night of April 1. The photos appear to show Robinson on a red couch, partially undressed. The detective said he could not determine from the images whether Robinson was alive or conscious when they were taken. 

**Judge Allows Limited Testimony After Dispute Over Abuse Allegations**

Tensions flared in the courtroom Wednesday as attorneys for both sides clashed over the scope of testimony allowed regarding Maxwell Anderson’s past behavior in a previous relationship. During testimony from Anderson’s ex-girlfriend, Judge Laura Crivello briefly excused the jury while lawyers debated whether evidence of emotional abuse could be introduced.

The dispute arose after defense attorney Anthony Cotton asked the witness whether Anderson had ever been physically abusive. She answered no. Prosecutors quickly objected, requesting a sidebar and later arguing that the question mischaracterized Anderson’s behavior and violated a prior agreement between both parties to avoid character evidence.

Assistant District Attorney Megan Newport argued that the defense’s question opened the door to further context. She cited three examples that suggested abuse in other forms: the ex-girlfriend’s prior statements to police that Anderson was emotionally abusive, an alleged 2022 bar fight with her ex-boyfriend, and a disturbing instance in which Anderson allegedly told her to “beat herself up” and then claim her ex-boyfriend caused her injuries.

“This was not something the state intended on eliciting,” Newport said, noting the state had stuck to the agreed-upon limits until the defense breached them. Cotton countered that distinguishing physical abuse from emotional abuse was key to his line of questioning and did not imply Anderson had a peaceful character overall.

Judge Crivello sided partially with the prosecution, ruling that the state could question the witness about the bar fight and the “beat herself up” comment—but not about claims of emotional abuse. When the jury returned, the prosecution narrowed its focus and asked only about the 2022 altercation at the bar.

**Forensic Expert: Deleted Photos and 
Netflix Activity Followed Date Night**

Digital forensic expert Jason Ruff of the Wisconsin Department of Justice testified Thursday that Maxwell Anderson’s phone data revealed multiple deleted images of Sade Robinson, some of which were referenced earlier in the trial.

According to Ruff, Anderson’s phone showed camera activity between 10:07 and 10:57 p.m. on April 1—the night of his date with Robinson. Just over an hour later, at 12:05 a.m., deletion activity began. Ruff told the jury that 32 images were modified, and by 12:08 a.m., there was no further human interaction with the phone. It later powered down due to a drained battery at 1:35 a.m., and turned back on around 9:20 a.m.

Ruff also revealed that Robinson’s Instagram page appeared to be viewed on Anderson’s phone on April 2 and 3, raising additional questions about his behavior in the days after her disappearance.

On Anderson’s computer, forensic data showed that Netflix was accessed starting at 12:07 a.m. on April 2. At least three episodes of Love, Death, and Robots played, followed by another science fiction series. No computer activity was logged after 12:28 a.m.

Prosecutors concluded their direct examination of Ruff shortly before lunch. The defense is expected to cross-examine him when court resumes at 1:30 p.m.

**Defense Highlights Lack of Suspicious Internet Searches on Anderson’s Devices**

As the defense began its case Wednesday afternoon, they resumed cross-examination of Jason Ruff, the digital forensic investigator who analyzed Maxwell Anderson’s electronics following Sade Robinson’s disappearance.

Ruff, a senior investigator with the Wisconsin Department of Justice’s Division of Criminal Investigation, confirmed that while Anderson’s phone and computer contained deleted images and app activity, there were no search queries for phrases such as “how to dispose of a body,” “how to remove DNA,” or “how to clean up a crime scene.”

This line of questioning appeared to support the defense’s effort to undercut any suggestion of premeditation or post-crime research on Anderson’s part.

Ruff reiterated that a total of 32 deleted cache photos were recovered from Anderson’s phone. He also restated that the phone powered off at 1:30 a.m. on April 2 due to a dead battery—information consistent with earlier testimony.

**Forensic Anthropologist Has History of Cracking Cold Cases**

Forensic anthropologist Jordan Karsten testified on June 5, bringing not only his expert analysis of Sade Robinson’s remains but also a notable track record of helping solve high-profile cold cases in Wisconsin and beyond.

Karsten, a professor at UW-Oshkosh and consultant for the Wisconsin DOJ’s crime lab, has lent his expertise to multiple long-unsolved investigations. Among them was the identification of skeletal remains belonging to a 7-year-old Michigan boy, helping close a 65-year-old cold case in Mequon. He also contributed to resolving the 1983 disappearance of Starkie Swenson, a Neenah man believed to have been murdered.

Karsten’s work extends internationally as well. According to the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, he played a role in identifying the remains of an American soldier who had been missing since World War II’s Normandy campaign.

**Prosecution Rests After Eight Days; Judge Denies Defense Motions**

At 2:30 p.m. on June 5, prosecutors officially rested their case against Maxwell Anderson, concluding eight days of testimony and over 60 witnesses. With the jury dismissed, the defense immediately challenged elements of the state’s charges.

Defense attorneys argued that two of the charges—hiding a corpse and mutilating a corpse—were “multiplicitous,” meaning they penalize the same conduct. Under Wisconsin law, a judge must determine whether the offenses are legally identical and whether the legislature intended for multiple punishments.

Judge Laura Crivello ruled that, at this stage, the charges are not multiplicitous and will both remain. She also denied the defense’s motion for a directed verdict, which would have dismissed the case if the judge found the prosecution’s evidence legally insufficient.

Crivello said that when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, the case warrants proceeding. 

**Judge Denies Directed Verdict; Defense Rests Without Calling Witnesses**

Judge Laura Crivello denied defense attorney Anthony Cotton’s request for a directed verdict on June 5, allowing the trial against Maxwell Anderson to proceed toward its conclusion. A directed verdict, as defined by the State Bar of Wisconsin, is when a judge instructs the jury to return a specific verdict based on the evidence presented, typically because one side argues there is no legal basis for conviction.

In this case, Crivello found the state’s evidence sufficient to let the jury decide the outcome.

Following the ruling, Cotton confirmed that the defense would not call any witnesses. With both sides having now rested, the trial will move into its final phase. Jurors are expected to hear closing arguments next, after which they will begin deliberations to determine Anderson’s fate.

**Both Sides Rest; Closing Arguments Next in Anderson Trial**

After seven days of testimony, more than 65 witnesses, and over 300 pieces of evidence, the state officially rested its case against Maxwell Anderson. The trial now moves into its final phase.

Outside the presence of the jury, defense attorney Anthony Cotton renewed his request for a directed verdict. Judge Laura Crivello denied the motion, stating that when viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution—as required by law—the evidence could support a guilty verdict by the jury.

Following the ruling, Cotton announced that the defense would not call any witnesses and formally rested its case.

Closing arguments are expected to begin shortly, with each side allotted 45 minutes to present their final statements before the jury begins deliberations.

**Judge Delivers Final Instructions to Jury Before Closing Arguments**

Circuit Court Judge Laura Crivello delivered final instructions to jurors Thursday morning as the homicide trial of Maxwell Anderson enters its final stage. With both the prosecution and defense set to begin their closing arguments—each allotted 45 minutes—Crivello emphasized the jury’s role and outlined the legal standards they must apply.

Among the key instructions:

	•If jurors are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Anderson committed first-degree intentional homicide, they may still consider the lesser charge of first-degree reckless homicide.

	•A unanimous verdict is required in a criminal trial. If the jury cannot reach one, a hung jury may be declared, and the case could be retried.

	•There is no time limit on deliberations. Jurors may take as long as needed—whether hours or weeks—to reach a decision.

“You jurors are the judges of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence,” Crivello stated, underscoring their responsibility.

She also warned them not to be influenced by any perception of her opinion on the case: “If any member of this jury has an impression of my opinion as to whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty, you should disregard that impression entirely.”

The panel—made up of 12 women and three men—was seated on May 27. Three jurors will be dismissed as alternates following instructions, leaving 12 to deliberate Anderson’s fate.

**In closing argument, Vance-Curzan describes Robinson**

Prosecutor Ian Vance-Curzan echoed his opening statement in his final message to jurors: use ""common sense and search for the truth.""

He soon turned to Robinson, the 19-year-old victim in the case. The attorney described her as ""anything and everything"" that someone that age would want to be. She worked two jobs, went to Milwaukee Area Technical College, supported herself and lived in a small studio apartment on the city's east side.

""Most of all, she was respected and loved by her family,"" Vance-Curzan said. ""She was fun, social and clearly anybody who cared about her deeply – until she came into contact with 33-year-old Maxwell Anderson.""

**Prosecutor Declares Anderson a ‘Killer’ in Emotionally Charged Closing Argument**

In a powerful and pointed closing argument, Assistant District Attorney Ian Vance-Curzan directly accused Maxwell Anderson of murdering and dismembering 19-year-old Sade Robinson, calling him a “killer” as he gestured toward the defendant in front of the jury.

Using a digital presentation, Vance-Curzan walked jurors through Robinson’s final days, combining surveillance footage, cell phone mapping, and forensic evidence to construct a narrative of premeditated violence. He alleged that Anderson lured Robinson back to his home, killed her, dismembered her body, and then spent the night driving around the city—disposing of her remains and torching her car.

The prosecutor underscored several key pieces of evidence: the deleted images from Anderson’s phone that appear to show Robinson incapacitated; the DNA of both individuals found on a sweater Anderson wore the next day; and the large backpack he was seen carrying—now missing.

As his argument reached its climax, Vance-Curzan didn’t hold back from the horror of the crime. “What kind of person cuts off someone’s head? A killer,” he said. “A killer who’s trying to get away with killing.”

He then pointed directly at Anderson. “There is no question about the person responsible for doing it. The killer—it’s him.”

As he finished, a brief moment of applause broke out from Robinson’s family seated in the gallery, underscoring the emotional weight of the moment.

**Defense Urges Jury to Set Emotions Aside, Argues Lack of Intent to Kill**

In his closing argument, defense attorney Anthony Cotton acknowledged the emotional weight of the case but urged jurors to remain focused on the evidence rather than the emotion surrounding Sade Robinson’s death.

“This is a highly emotionally charged case,” Cotton said. “But I ask you to check your emotions at the door.”

Cotton challenged the prosecution’s narrative, highlighting what he saw as gaps in the state’s case. He emphasized that Maxwell Anderson’s DNA was not found in Robinson’s burned vehicle, nor was Robinson’s DNA discovered in Anderson’s home—both facts he said cast doubt on the allegations.

“The DNA was powerful for us,” Cotton told the jury.

He also asked jurors to consider each charge against Anderson separately and not to assume guilt across the board.

“I didn’t see any evidence of an intent to kill Sade,” Cotton said, reinforcing the defense’s position that the prosecution failed to prove Anderson acted with the level of intent required for a conviction of first-degree intentional homicide.

**In rebuttal, Vance-Curzan criticizes defense's argument**

In a sharp rebuttal following the defense’s closing argument, Assistant District Attorney Ian Vance-Curzan dismantled the idea that Maxwell Anderson’s calm demeanor in the days after Sade Robinson’s disappearance indicated innocence.

After defense attorney Anthony Cotton pointed to Anderson going to work and not changing his routine as evidence of his innocence, Vance-Curzan countered: “He thought he was going to get away with it. That’s the whole point.”

Vance-Curzan also pushed back against the defense’s emphasis on Anderson’s clean shoes, worn the day Robinson’s torched car was found. Rather than proving anything, he argued, they raised more questions—particularly when considered alongside the now-missing “massive backpack” Anderson was seen wearing.

Turning to the defense’s claim that Anderson may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time, Vance-Curzan challenged the jury to consider one critical detail: “Why on earth is he walking around behind an abandoned building?”

**Jury begans deliberations**

Judge Laura Crivello has instructed jurors of the charges to be considered, and deliberations began at about 4:40 p.m.

The jury will decide on several charges, including first-degree intentional homicide or first-degree reckless homicide; mutilating a corpse; and arson.

Crivello said she would have the jury return to court at about 4:57 p.m. and end its session for the day, unless the jury reaches a verdict.",Twisted Fisherman,35,67,2025-06-05 08:39:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1l3zg4n/maxwell_anderson_trial_in_milwaukee_day_8_updates/,milwaukee,0.0013956734124214933,neutral

* Is there a museum we should not miss? (We plan to go to the Art Museum but we are open to switching to something smaller, different, interesting. We are more into modern art but also curious about weird stuff -- from the print museum up in Two Rivers to the National Mustard Museum in Middleton).
* Is there a coffee shop that is absolutely a must - in addition to good coffee we are looking for ambiance/preservation vibes: converted church, rehabbed firehouse, restored train station, etc are some of the coffee shops that we loved visiting in our trips.
* A neighborhood with some architectural interest? Or with some serious cultural diversity?
* A microbrewery. Anything with a citrus hazy IPA would be nice.
* An independent bookstore (if there is any left).
* Something/anything that you feel compelled to recommend for reasons that we may never comprehend but maybe appreciate when we get there?

50,1pahx9l,"Milwaukee, where do you actually eat?","

Hi,  
We’re four guys who mapped out Milwaukee’s dining scene in an app called Vota. The idea is straightforward: you see two places side by side (Sanford vs AJ Bombers), pick the one you prefer, and the ranking updates instantly. The more people vote, the sharper and more accurate the list becomes. There are still a few duplicates here and there, but we’re cleaning the data nonstop.

I know this can look like self-promotion, and I get that city subreddits get tired of repeat posts, but a bunch of you have already rated places around Milwaukee and the feedback has been surprisingly positive. The usual complaints were “no Android” (fixed now) and “no website” (coming soon). If this annoys you, feel free to ignore me and I won’t post again. No sponsorships, no restaurant deals, nothing commercial. Just locals shaping the ranking.

Here’s the iPhone version, with categories matched to what people actually eat in Milwaukee:

51,1k73mf2,New upper east side apartment reaches 100% capacity,"""If you build it, they will come."" The Fitz apartment complex just reached 100% occupancy, per their IG in less than 11 months. I'm not affiliated just saw it shared on Insta.

Despite pushback against new apartments in Milwaukee, especially on Reddit, this shows that well-located, walkable housing is both needed and in demand.

In my opinion, the Fitz's location is better than the Couture or 333 Water (and obviously smaller in scale), but if walkable amenities can be added to those areas, there's no reason they can't fill up too. The Fitz is also visually appealing and fits the neighborhood well.

I'm hopeful the 7-story project on Stowell near Downer moves forward.

Easton Apts
Yankee Hills Apts
Riverplace Lofts
City Green Apartments
Pritzala Lofts
Urbanite
Nova
Contour Apts 
Quin Apartments 
The Fitz

Does anyone live in these buildings or has previously and can speak to my question? Or indicate any buildings I should avoid? (Might add a few more to the list). Before anyone comments bugs are inevitable in a city, I can live if I see one or two a year. But anything more than that to me is an insulation and bug treatment problem. Ive lived smack in the middle of Philadelphia for the past 5 years and I have never once seen a bug in my apartment.

55,1p7fyp4,Information for hunters re: missing people this season,"Greetings. As hunting season approaches, I am creating missing persons lists so people can help search while hunting.

Despite having only 222 missing adults and 31 children on national databases NamUs and NCMEC for all of Wisconsin, Milwaukee ALONE has [over 500 missing people at any time](https://mediamilwaukee.com/special-projects/missing-in-milwaukee/).

The laws and procedures in Wisconsin do not require reporting missing people to these databases. Therefore, the true epidemic of missing people is misunderstood as even news sources misreport the number.

I do not have access to the full list of missing people – only the police have that. However, these are the reported missing below. They are some of the cold cases – also a few newer ones. These all deserve attention for the sake of the families. I've listed them below, also a link to a page with more information for each. Please keep on the lookout for them as well as evidence of them. I am doing this to help these families get some closure, so please don’t downvote. There are a couple I have left out because of recent developments, but most are here.

64,1l1hda6,Need travel advice,"Hi everyone!
I am in florida and my bf goes to wisconsin every summer for work and I let him take my car because his car is too old for the journey.
Anyway, I have to get my car back so I decided on getting a one way rental car from my town in central fl to the Milwaukee Airport. Once I get there though I have to get from the Milwaukee Airport to where my car is in a town called Wisconsin Rapids. What is the cheapest way to get there? Is there a bus, or train or is uber even possible. is anyone from that town going to be at the airport next Tuesday and wants company on the ride home (jk).
But if anyone has tips let me know!
I had the option to drop the car in a town called wasau but it was 200$ more. 
There is also an airport in wasau but flights from either tampa or Orlando are ridiculous. Going to milwaukee seems like the cheapest option.
And yeah..my bf could help but he ""can't take time off work""

Thanks!!

Edit: thank you everyone! The bus only goes to Steven’s point now for those who need to know in the future. I called them. They must have torn down the bus station..idk. 

Edit again for anyone who cares..have a flight from Sanford  airport (about an hour from my house) to Appleton and since it lands at 10pm and is closer my bf will pick me up.
