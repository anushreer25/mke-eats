We figured one of us would leave with her if she couldn’t handle it but thankfully she was great. She had a pasta dish that we sold to her as mac n cheese, and the staff was very gracious about it (and we were working hard to keep her on her best behavior which I think they appreciated).

25,1ldntpy,"Yeah, and what we need is more affordable housing. 


Its laughable to Me that people believe that trickle down housing is the answer. ""Yeah, so in 2027, maybe a few people will move up from mid price apartments and into the Edison, and those vacancies will trickle down and there will be a few hundred more affordable units in the city. Or maybe it will just be slowly filled by well to do people moving to the city, and other housing will be unaffected. Good luck!""


What we need is affordable housing, anf lots of it. Lots and lots. Thousands of units. Because it isn't just a matter of not enough housing, its that too much of it is priced In a way that many people can't afford and if many others are living very precariously due to rent taking a large proportion of their paychecks and could easily be made homeless by a car accident, illness, or other financial impact. The couture, 333, and the plyscrapee aren't going to change that.

We had a great long weekend in your fair city, thanks in part to all the suggestions and discussion you offered here. Of course it was impossible to try everything. This was our first trip to MKE but we'll be back.

Saint Kate was a great hotel - with a ProofPizza counter that came handy for a snack. Great pizza. Next time we'll explore something closer to a lively neighborhood -- perhaps an AirBnB -- but for a starting point Saint Kate was excellent and within walking distance from our key points this trip.

MAM is a great museum -- we took a detour on the way there to check the street fair by the Public Market. And got a little bit distracted by the festivities at the Italian Community Center, but we finally made it to the museum. Today we even watched its wings opening up. As much as I love Chicago's sprawling museums, I prefer smaller ones that can be viewed in 3 hours or less. MAM right on the edge there. Best ever? Kohler museum in Sheboygan -- the art place, not the product exhibit next to the factory.

Discourse was an amazing coffee shop. I tried their Channel Orange and Moonwater -- outstanding drinks. And while I was waiting for them I tried a plain espresso just to gauge the basic stuff. Most excellent. MSOE people are so fortunate.

Dinning wise, we loved both our choices: Morel and Saffron. Having dinned at Morel, can I now legitimately claim that I had a meal near with Jeffrey Dahmer had his? Or would that be too insensitive? 

The food at Morel was great and the service very friendly. Same for Saffron. We took the river walk to/from both restaurants and it was a marvelous experience.

Maybe I was a bit optimistic with our schedule but we did not have time for microbreweries and bookstores. Next time. But I can tell you that the bar at the ground floor at Saint Kate makes a mean gin martini.

For years, we've been driving through MKE on our way to our property up on Washington Island. I am glad this time we decided to stop for a couple of nights. We'll be back definitely. 

Thanks for the tips everyone.

96,1jj9jqh,"you raise a fantastic point. upon further consideration, i never actually disagreed with westmoreland’s messaging at all, i am just uncomfortable with the somewhat racially charged tone of it—but it would be disingenuous of me to pretend that that isn’t a part of the issue, especially when coming from their black alderman. but, that is the area that *he* is representing, and he obviously would know it much better than i. from where i stand, i see litter as more of a symptom of the deeper problem that makes milwaukee such a segregated city, and so im more inclined to want to look at the root cause rather than the details that come as a result of it. i think that black communities need more direct support, less shame, especially about something that’s being treated as a cosmetic issue (let alone the environmental consequences). that’s where my sentiment initially came from. i’m typically very pro-aggressive-action, but i guess it feels a bit different when directed towards my own city. tough love and whatnot. the hostile tone of their initial response didn’t help, though.

you are right though, that if i care, i’ll do more than just advocate for less anger on the internet. i already spend some days de-trashing parts of my neighborhood, but if i actually give a shit i will do more than just that. i do genuinely hope that alderman westmoreland’s message leads to some change of behavior.",Morel,8,2025-03-25 09:30:21,0.007905138339920948,neutral
97,1jj9jqh,"You are reading something that wasn't written.

Alder Westmoreland clearly sees himself as a leader of the people of his neighborhood, many of whom look like him. Those people are (a) fulfilling every stereotype that people outside the city have of them, (b) screwing up the space where he lives, and (c) making him, personally, look like a clown. It would be more embarrassing if he weren't angry. 

If you are not a litterer, then this letter is not talking to you no matter what color you are. In fact, if you are a Black person in this city, you should be mad at the litterers, not him. They are making you look bad too.

To save money, call the Enterprise location directly to make reservations where you are flying from. Everytime I fly from Appleton to Sanford, I always have to pay extra for my rental car because I booked through Allegiant.
