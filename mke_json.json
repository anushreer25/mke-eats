We then had the meat and cheese board for our appetizer. All the accoutrements were so fresh and the sweet drop peppers were something I had never tried before. For entrees I got the Gnocchi with chicken and she had the Carbonara. One of the best meals I have eaten in a long, especially since moving to Milwaukee. I would highly recommend Onesto for a date night or special occasion if you’re in the Milwaukee area! 10/10 experience from start to finish.",

Ended up flagging down someone clearing a table. Asked for a sauce and soy sauce. The soy was on the table. Hadn't noticed. It wasn't marked. The other sauce was an upcharge. Not mentioned, didn't know until I saw the check.\n\nFriendly server, but poor service.\n\nThe roll was tasty. Tasted much better with the sauce.

I was shocked that they didn’t have the peppercorn sauce for the burger Au Poivre, and they only sell chicken sandwiches on select days. But, the worst was the service and the automatic charge of 20%, so the server Faith was not motivated to check to see if we had everything we needed, didn’t try to refill our water glasses, we had to ask someone else to bring ketchup, when we asked for straws, instead of wrapping in a napkin, she brought them loose with her fingers and just plopped them in our water glasses, and when she brought the napkin and utensils, she touched the top that touches our food and goes into our mouth with her fingers.  She never said thank you, and clearly, did not appreciate us as customers.\nI rarely write reviews, but this was by far one of the worst experiences I’ve had at Elsa’s or AZ88, which I visit often since I live in Phoenix.",

It’s good food, interesting ambience, and a great place to grab a few cocktails and hang out.\n\nI brought my young son, and he tore into his grilled cheese sandwich, so yes, they’re known for their burgers, but they definitely have other worthwhile options on the menu.\n\nThey’re basically a Milwaukee staple at this point. A great spot to start a night out—or finish one.\n\nBy the way, you'll get a postcard when you pay your check. Fill it out, and add someone's address. They'll mail it out for you.",

I wanted to try something new and I’ll never go to this establishment again.\n\nI’m all about supporting small businesses but this made me really upset and I can’t support a business like this. I got a meal with egg rolls and it cost $26 and they also charged me a container fee. The containers cost a penny and they’re charging .60 cents what a ripoff plus they wanted a tip for ordering to go what a joke. I hope all customers aren’t treated this way",

Also, when a customer says they did not enjoy something offer them something else or take the dish off the bill. We only ate a couple bits because we were trying it and hungry waiting for our server to come back. When we spoke with our server about not enjoying the dish she got incredibly disrespectful including telling us to read the menu (although we did) and that if we didn't \"want\" to pay for the dish that they are hiring (it's not about money it's about ethics). She was very sassy and left a very sour taste in our mouths. We will most likely never go back. There are plenty of delicious, reasonably priced, and wonderful latinx restaurants in Milwaukee.

The service is super fast, the waitresses are incredibly attentive—\"IF YOU'RE WHITE, OF COURSE.\" Today I went with my family, arrived, sat down at a table, everything seemed normal, but the waitresses never offered us the menu, much less served us. But a white person arrived five minutes after us, and the waitress already had the menu ready for them before they even sat down.

Thank you for your feedback.\n\n\nLamento la experiencia que tuvieron. Su familia se sentó por su cuenta y nuestro equipo no se dio cuenta de inmediato. El otro grupo entró justo cuando una colaboradora estaba cerca de la puerta, por eso fueron atendidos enseguida — fue un tema de tiempo, no algo intencional.\n\nComo restaurante de dueña latina, damos la misma bienvenida a todos. \n",

The only good thing about the food was that they gave a ton of fries (soggy but probably because it was takeout) and the portion was overall big. However, the burger did not taste good and the meat quality seemed poor. The chicken tenders were actually just huge chicken cutlets and tasted bland. The restaurant provided a bunch of sauces which was nice but still didn’t help the food. I’ve been to Copper before and the service when you dine in/drink is very good. I would recommend sticking to their drinks and passing on the food.",

I’m here for a good time not a long time though so it works perfect for me.\n\nMy bartender’s name was Sam. Nice dude. It was honestly the perfect vibe for a crappy mood.

      "text": "My wife and I had been here for drinks this past summer and it was on our list to try it out for dinner.  We went on a Friday night in December with 7pm reservations.  Everything was perfect.  We started out with a couple of cocktails from their menu while we waited for our table at the bar.  The bartender took special care preparing the drinks and they were delicious. When it was time to get our table and eat we were very happy with our spot in front of the window looking out on Brady street. The dining area has a great vibe and the playlist they had going was right up our alley. Our server was knowledgeable and on top of it. We had the chicken liver mousse, diplomat fries, cheese burger, trout and everything was great, especially the burger.  We will be returning soon.",

All of these dishes were fantastic. The sourdough bread was amazing with the compound butter - definitely try it. You must get the Diplomac. This burger may actually be the best burger I have had. It’s nothing crazy, just a classic burger but done so ridiculously well. The American cheese in every bite was just something else. If you like burgers, you need to try this burger.\n\nCocktails were great and the beers and wines were also good. Service was great - the bartender took care of the bar whole room, not just the bar. Massively impressive because he was super polite and welcoming alongside that. Ambiance was also just cozy and great for a laid back date night.\n\nTLDR: Definitely recommend and get the burger. I cannot wait to come back!",

      "text": "EDIT!!!! AND PLEASE READ! Amazing. The food..beyond any expectations and lick the plate clean...to the last bite.\n\nHERE IS UPDATED REVIEW..PLEASE BEAWARE:\nHave always had a decent time at The Diplomat, until last night. The owners, both of them, are the rudest, condescending, zero customer service skills I have ever seen. My very lengthy YELP review goes into more and after reading a couple of the less than great reviews on here I see this is typical behavior for them. The female owner was rude from the start with aunt. We order small plates but our entrees were taking longer than normal. Bartender went to see what was going on. They missed our ticket completely and would make our food as soon as they could. I asked if something could be done about this and the wait. Apparently you aren't allowed to question thier terrible service. We were give two options. They will pay for our meal so far but we would NOT be served our entrees and we can leave OR they won't pay for anything and we will be served our entrees. It was ridiculous, I questioned why these were our options. The male owner and chef came out by us, yelled, belittled, made a scene in front of everyone. We decided to cut our losses and just finish our fries and leave, which we werent allowed to do. Female owner began taking our plates away mid bites.\n\nThey wouldn't let us tip the bartender- said they would, even tho we tried\nI was accused of only wanting something for free-NOT THE CASE AT ALL\nWe were yelled at FOR THEIR MISTAKE YOU FORGOT OUR FOOD!\nGot home and immediately reviewed them at almost 10PM I started receiving calls from the Diplomat, which i rejected but they would call back right away. 10pm!?!? This is a very late time to call someone and EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL. No voicemail was left. From another review they must have been calling to yell at me again. Proceed with caution when you visit this establishment as one other other the ego of the chef is out of control. There is a high chance you will be assaulted at the least verbally by the chef. Really hope they do not treat their staff this way also.\n\nTo the Diplomat- DO NOT CALL ME AGAIN.",

The customer service is horrible — they talk to you like you don’t matter and definitely don’t appreciate your business.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that they overcharge for the items they forget, give no apology, no explanation, and make zero effort to make it right. It’s always just “we forgot,” and that’s it. No professionalism at all. I really wanted to support this business, but the disrespect and lack of care is unbelievable.\n\nWould not recommend.",

The burrata tartine was fresh and flavorful, and the burrata and grilled veggie sandwich was outstanding—perfectly balanced and even better with the side of fries. We finished with the carrot cake, which was incredibly moist and the ideal ending to the meal.\n\nWe sat on the top floor, and since it was November, the space was decorated for the holidays. The atmosphere felt magical—cozy, warm, and festive without being over the top. A perfect spot for a seasonal outing or a relaxing bite with great food.",

      "text": "On our first day of vacation in the fine city of Milwaukee my girlfriend and I had it in mind to enjoy a light lunch before an evening barcrawl. We found ourselves at this lively establishment the swinging door exchange. We came in around 1pm and the lunch rush was in full swing. We were seated within about 20 mins which was fine. We both imbibed in some craft beer and split the tuna melt sandwich with fries. It hit the spot contently. We had it in mind to stop by again before our departure from the city but it wasn't to be. However i believe i can firmly recommend this cozy eatery for a sumptous lunch or dinner.",

The potatoes are average. I love the fried green tomatoes and grits what an amazing dish that's all I would recommend from here. The waitress was great the people are great the place is clean and amazing looking. The food doesn't live up to the hype. My friend got another dish she had to send back because it wasn't made right and didn't taste right I can't comment on that dish because it was shrimp and I'm allergic!!!!! So j hate shrimp. The steak was really inedible remove it from the menu and replace it with a nice chuck!!!!!",

It wasnt bad, but the pasta to filling ratio was off , the filling itself was somewhat bland, and the sage butter did not come through very well.\n\nThe drinks were great! Service was great!\n\nAll and all, not a BAD meal by any means, but for the price point and hype… I won’t lie I was expecting near perfection.",

We began with the carpaccio and a fall-harvest style salad (can’t remember the exact name)… both were absolutely delicious.\n\nFor mains, we shared three dishes, and I genuinely can’t pick a favorite… they were all outstanding. The prosciutto-wrapped halibut with mushroom risotto was rich and perfectly executed. The roasted squash and broccoli over peanut mole was unique, flavorful, and beautifully plated. And the housemade pappardelle with shrimp, fennel, and nduja was perfection… fresh pasta with incredible depth of flavor.\n\nEverything we ate was balanced, thoughtful, and just plain delicious.

      "text": "Tried Buckleys with my family tonight based on a recommendation while visiting Milwaukee. Ordered the fried artichoke, the empanadas and focaccia appetizers, they  were all good. For our entrees we ordered the pork chop, chicken marsala and both my son and daughter ordered the pesto pasta. Pork chop and chicken were cooked well but both pastas dishes were very undercooked (seems to be a common occurrence as other reviews mention). They were not “al dente” but rather had a very starchy, hard to chew inedible texture so we brought it up to our server’s attention after the first bite, both dishes were lukewarm. He took both dishes back to the kitchen returning a minute later with an answer from the chef saying “that’s how they cook it and it is correct” which made for a very awkward moment. He offered to either leave us the dishes that he had taken back to the kitchen or that they could remake them. We asked for them to be remade since they were inedible, bringing the remade dishes about 10 minutes later when we were almost done eating our other entrees. The remade pasta was a little better but it still had a harder chew texture than what you would expect, I wouldn’t be surprised if the same pasta was just reheated, just not a good enjoyable dish. In hindsight offering to try a non pasta dish as an alternative would’ve been a better option if that’s how they serve all their pasta dishes. We didn’t say anything else since my kids were hungry and we were also celebrating my sons birthday, the overall experience had already been awkward. We did order the chocolate and carrots cakes for dessert which were very good. No manager came by at any point to check on the situation afterwards which I found odd for this type of restaurant and price point.",

The service was impeccable. And the atmosphere was delightful; we were lucky enough to walk in late and get a cozy table for two in the window in the bar area.  Loved everything about our experience. Will definitely be back!!",

Was told the reason was because my mom had on active wear [tennis shoes and socks]. However, we could spot other patrons that were seated with jeans and tennis shoes/casual wear. Host and other staff were rude and suggested we go next door to Kohls to purchase attire that would meet dress code. We drove 40 mins to downtown to have dinner for my mom's birthday. We were truly disappointed and embarrassed. Dress code was never mentioned when booking reservation. I have been to Capital Grille a number of times/locations and never had a issue.",

The receptionist greeted us and knew who we were from our call and made all our servers aware that we were on a schedule.  Everyone treated us with a smile and the service was prompt.  The menu was rather traditional with a few daily specials.   I hade a beautiful spinache salad a fabulous filet and we shared a potato side dish.  The meat was cooked to perfection  and the garlic mashed potatoes were great.  We would have loved to stay for dessert but I didn't want to be too full or get sleepy at the show. The decor was old school, a little dark but clean and well kept. I will go back next time I bam in town to try that lobster bisque!",

The restaurant is both pretty and intimate, the expertly prepared food is at different times elegant and bold, but it is the warmth and hospitality that we felt that I believe we will be most reminiscing about in the years to come.",

      "text": "My wife and I celebrated our anniversary at CAVAS, and I can honestly say it was one of the most special dining experiences we’ve ever had in Milwaukee. From the moment we walked in, we felt as though we’d been welcomed into the home of an established Spanish or Argentinian chef. Chef Ana and her husband Peter bring such warmth, hospitality, and passion to every detail — it’s clear this is more than just a restaurant, it’s their craft and their home.\n\nThe food was nothing short of phenomenal. Each course felt thoughtfully curated, beautifully presented, and bursting with authentic flavor. We’ve dined at many restaurants in the city, but nothing compares to the intimacy and care you feel here. It’s rare to find a place where you can experience both world-class cuisine and the personal touch of the people behind it.\n\nCAVAS is truly a hidden gem — Milwaukee is lucky to have it. If you’re looking for an unforgettable dining experience, whether for a special occasion or simply to treat yourself, I cannot recommend it highly enough.",

The food, from sweet to savoury, is delicious! The pancakes are superb! A place you MUST visit if you go to Milwaukee!

Unfortunately our experience did not at all match my excitement.\n\nThe restaurant atmosphere was lovely and wait staff seemed friendly and professional. However the kitchen and staff were obviously overmatched for the number of patrons, even though it was only a Monday night. The kitchen was so backed up that for a party of only two we had to wait for our appetizer, and then over 45 minutes more for our entrees of one steak and one sea bass. In fairness, both the waiter and head of house came to apologize for our experience saying there was a large party that had the kitchen backed up, and they brought us...bread...\"on the house\"...but that was all.\n\nOverall, the experience just wasn't up to par with a restaurant fashioning itself to be fine dining. Portions are limited. Prices of course are quite high. The strain on the kitchen seemed to also affect the flavor as the sea bass was not cooked well and lacked flavor. It just wasn't good enough for what we had to pay.\n\nUnfortunately do not recommend.",

I came with my husband at around 6pm on Saturday. As soon as we walked in we were stared at and it was a weird vibe. We shrugged it off and sat at a table and I asked the server about the happy hour deals that my coworker told me about and that I see posted all over the restaurants Facebook. And was told there was no happy hour because the bar was backed up and management was stopping the deal. It’s supposed to be 3-9pm Wednesday-Sunday. And there are no disclaimers anywhere starting the specials might randomly start and stop. The bar was full but we were only the 3rd table in the entire restaurant … so I don’t understand how they were so backed up and unable to honor the specials they advertise. We immediately left. And I will not be recommending to anybody due to false advertising. Don’t promote constantly your great deals if they aren’t valid.",

This is certainly not the level of hospitality we hold ourselves to at La Merenda, and it does not reflect who we are or how we want our guests to feel when they walk through our doors.\n\nWe take your feedback seriously. We have addressed the situation internally and taken disciplinary action with the employee involved to ensure this does not happen again.\n\nI would truly appreciate the opportunity to speak with you directly so I can learn more about what happened and hopefully make things right. Please feel free to reach me at info@lamerenda125.com\n.\n\nThank you for bringing this to our attention, and again, my sincere apologies for your experience.\n\n— La Merenda Management",

Had to wait and wait for the bill. I had to eat while my food was warm and my husband had none, then I finished and then my husband finally got his food. Also was a bit creeped out by the bartender trying to clean me up.",
