East Town Kitchen + Bar,The Milwaukee brewing industry has broken my heart.,"Hey all. If you've ever been to a brewery in Milwaukee there's a good chance I've poured you a beer. My most recent job was Triple Taproom and Kitchen (aka Hacienda, also 3 Sheeps involved) on the east side. Today, I(along with the rest of the staff) received a message from the ""director of operations"" that we were closed permanently, effective immediately.

Unfortunately this is not the first place in Milwaukee I've worked that has closed. Not all as a blindside to employees, but nonetheless... I worked at Milwaukee Brewing Company when they closed. I worked at Mobcraft when they closed their doors. I worked at Fuel Cafe when they blindsided their employees(not a brewery, I know).  I've worked at Broken Bat, Gathering Place, and Central Waters (I was fired from there for questioning a manager illegally stealing tips from employees).

I'll say that I am a huge beer fan and honestly moved to Milwaukee due to it's reputation as an amazing beer city with rich beer culture. I had previously worked in downtown San Diego at an amazing little brewery, along with my Australian husband (who currently works at a Milwaukee brewery who has honestly treated him very well).

The main reason I'm posting this is due to the multiple blindsides from places who couldn't care less about their employees livelihoods, I am unable to connect with bar guests who I've come to know and love over my years in the industry in Milwaukee. If you know me, I'm the girl with braids, who probably cares too much, about beer, and her customers, and is absolutely heartbroken about all the connections I've had that I have no way to reach out to after the abrupt endings at so many beloved breweries I've worked at over my 4.5 years in Milwaukee. I would love to hear from you all!

East Town Kitchen + Bar,Historic streams and current flood risk map,"I’ve created a map using zillow’s flood risk hazard layer and a historic streams map from the Original Plat Maps of the Wisconsin Public Land Surveys in 1835-1837. Keep in mind that old surveys may not line up exactly with modern streams. Most of us know about FEMA floodplains and the existing rivers in MKE county but there’s more than meets the eye. 

Unfortunately there’s a disconnect between our built environment and the land we’re occupying. MMSD is an incredible provider of infrastructure and flood control but it’s simply not enough to counter historic rains on top of historic marshes, swamps, wetlands, and streams. Both pieces of data are public through Zillow (flood risk) and MMSD (historic streams); If you are looking at buying a home make sure to understand your flood risk beyond FEMA zones!

East Town Kitchen + Bar,Spicy Food in Milwaukee?,"Intensity over flavor.

Which Milwaukee restaurants have at least one spicy dish on the menu that will make even the strongest among us break a sweat?

I’ve been doing a series since the end of 2023 of ordering the spiciest options I can find, specifically within the city of Milwaukee.

From A-Z, here’s where I’ve gone so far:
- China Gourmet (level 5 + chili oil)
- EE-Sane (level 25 … off menu limit)*
- Emperor of China (hot + spicy … ’make it spicy’ requested)
- Hot Dish Pantry (nashville hot fried pork tenderloin sammy)
- Immy’s African Cuisine (smoked jerk chicken)
- Jack’s American Pub (dragon sauce)**
- Lucky Ginger (dragon’s breath)
- Lucky Liu’s (szechwan chicken)
- Paloma’s (demon s*men)
- Pepperpot Jamaican Cuisine (jerk chicken rice bowl and spicy wings)
- Pho 414 in Hmong Town (extreme fire with 5 spicy scoops)*
- Room Service (level 3)
- Sticky Rice (very hot sauce w/ volcano chicken)
- Thai A Kitchen (level 4 red curry)
- TODD ‘I Believe I Can Fry’ (szechuan spice/dry rub and mango habanero sauce)

There were a few others that weren’t spicy to me, so I didn’t add them to the series.

*Spiciest is a three-way tie between EE-Sane (most think level 10 is the max, off menu they go to level 25), Pho 414 in Hmong Town, and Jack’s American Pub.

**Jack’s American Pub’s dragon sauce wings were the biggest surprise for me, I didn’t expect them to bring the heat.",33,39,2025-08-11 18:14:45,1mnsfhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1mnsfhk/spicy_food_in_milwaukee/,milwaukee,restaurant_mention

Onesto,<$50 pp restaurant?,"Hello party people of Milwaukee. I’ve been snooping this sub for a bit and I am excited to be coming to your city for the first time. 
I realize that it’ll be busy with the brewers doing the way they are -congrats! 

As the title states I am looking for a place with ~$100 budget for two that’s nice for dinner. We like good food more than we like fancy food and though I realize there is some overlap there. 
I am also looking for something that’s not bar-centric since I’ll be getting plenty of burgers, wings, pizza, cheese curds, beer in my visit to Wi. And to my partners preference no Thai places for us ☹️ 

Staying in Third Ward like every other visitor but I’ll have a rental car. 

Edit: for anyone like me who searches old threads. I went to Momo mee twice during my time there. I had made reservations for onesto and also for la Merenda but my gf was really digging the xiao long bao. We actually also stopped there for lunch on our way out. 
The fish market and salad bar were good at the market. Hit up club giralbaldi for smoked wings. It was fine. Not something I’d go hunting for but a great place to watch some football. 
I also went to tin window bc at random and Bryant’s were closed. I didn’t dislike it but not something I’d go back for.  ",2,17,2025-10-14 21:38:14,1o6zdrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1o6zdrl/50_pp_restaurant/,milwaukee,restaurant_mention

La Caribeña The best Caribbean family restaurant,Support Shah Jees! ,"Shah Jees will be closing if they can’t raise enough money on their go fund me. I unfortunately can’t post the link due to community guidelines, but happy to send the link to those interested. 

Shah Jees has been a lunch time institution, and (arguably) some of the best food in the city. 

The original post from the go fund me site: 
“Hello Everyone,

I want to introduce you to my dad, the heart and soul behind Shah Jee’s, a beloved restaurant in the heart of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. My dad immigrated to this country in 1985, chasing the American Dream. He found that dream when he left behind his banking job in New York City and moved to Milwaukee to build a name of his own, starting with his passion for cooking. 30 years later, Shah Jee’s is a testament to his dedication and perseverance. For 30 years, he has poured his love, passion, and talent into this restaurant, creating a place where food is more than just a meal—it’s a connection, a memory, a taste of home.

My dad’s food is like no other. His flavors are unique, his service is unmatched, and to the countless loyal customers who have walked through our doors, Shah Jee’s is more than just a restaurant—it’s a family. Over the years, his hard work and devotion have earned Shah Jee’s the title of “The Gem of the City.”

Not only did my dad grow Shah Jee’s into a cherished spot in the community, but he also expanded, opening three more restaurants around the Milwaukee area. Unfortunately, like so many others, he faced unimaginable hardship when the pandemic hit. Despite his best efforts to keep prices affordable and service exceptional, the lockdown forced him to close all three new locations. This setback has deeply affected the business, and he’s been doing everything he can to keep the original downtown location open. But, it’s become harder each day, and my dad now fears that he may have to close his restaurant for good.

Shah Jee’s is more than just a business to my dad; it’s his pride, his joy, and the product of 30 years of tireless work. To see it slip away would break his heart and ours.

My dad is a man who has always given to others, quietly supporting and helping everyone around him. He’s a loving father, a selfless friend, and a respected pillar of the Milwaukee community. But asking for help? That’s not something he does. And so, we're asking for him.

If you can, please consider supporting Shah Jee’s in any way you can. Every donation will help my dad keep his dream alive—allowing him to continue doing what he loves most, while serving our community with the food and care he’s known for. Your support would mean the world to us.

Thank you, from the bottom of our hearts,
His loving daughters”",31,22,2024-12-17 15:55:46,1hglxs5,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1hglxs5/support_shah_jees/,milwaukee,restaurant_mention

State Street Pizza Pub,Maxwell Anderson Trial in Milwaukee: Day 5 Updates,"**Note:** This post is intended to share information from publicly available reporting on the Maxwell Anderson trial in Milwaukee. It is meant to inform and provide space for thoughtful, respectful discussion about the case. Please keep comments civil and sensitive to the nature of the topic and those impacted.

**Content Warning:** This post contains descriptions of violence and graphic forensic details from an ongoing murder trial. Reader discretion is advised. The defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty in a court of law.

*Last Updated: 17:41 p.m. CST — June 01, 2025. This post will continue to be updated throughout the day as new information becomes available.*

**Prosecutors Build Case Foundation in Trial's Opening Week**

During the first week of the trial, prosecutors laid out a detailed and methodical account of Sade Robinson's final day and the discovery of her burned vehicle. Jurors were presented with messages exchanged between Robinson and Maxwell Anderson as they arranged a date in downtown Milwaukee. They reviewed cell phone data tracing Robinson's movements throughout the city and viewed surveillance footage capturing her leaving home, arriving at work, and later departing.

Testimony from police and witnesses described the discovery of Robinson's remains and a broken gate near the location where one of her legs was found. Investigators noted the ""smooth"" nature of the cuts, suggesting deliberate dismemberment.

On May 29 and 30, the prosecution focused on Robinson's torched car. Jurors saw photographs of scorched belongings found inside the vehicle, including a pair of white sneakers matching the ones she was last seen wearing. Police testified that the driver's seat was positioned for someone significantly taller than Robinson. Surveillance footage showed the vehicle's movements before it was set ablaze, as well as a person—alleged by prosecutors to be Anderson—seen walking away from the scene.

Throughout the week, Anderson's defense team challenged the prosecution's case during cross-examination. They emphasized that there is no direct DNA, forensic evidence, or video footage conclusively linking Anderson to Robinson's death. Defense attorney Anthony Cotton had investigators confirm that the surveillance video does not clearly show who was driving Robinson's car and that there is no footage of the car being left at the site where it was found burned. Cotton also argued that Anderson had no motive.

**Former Tenant of Maxwell Anderson Takes the Stand**

On the fifth day of the trial, June 2, prosecutors called Maxwell Anderson’s former tenant to the stand. The 34-year-old man, whose identity was withheld at the prosecution’s request, previously rented the lower unit of Anderson’s former duplex on Milwaukee’s south side. Anderson lived in the upper unit at the time but has since sold the property.

The tenant testified that he and Anderson had known each other since childhood and socialized during his first year renting the unit. That dynamic shifted after the first year, with their relationship becoming strained.

“I would call him an insufferable landlord,” the tenant said.

He described deteriorating living conditions, particularly in the shared basement where Anderson kept kennels for his two dogs. The tenant said the dogs frequently defecated in the basement, creating a “horrid smelling” environment that eventually forced him to do his laundry elsewhere during his final month in the home.

He lived in the unit for about two years until police swarmed the property in April 2024 as part of their investigation into Sade Robinson’s disappearance.

**Medical Examiner Details Extent of Injuries to Sade Robinson**

Dr. Lauren Decker, assistant medical examiner of Milwaukee County, provided graphic and critical testimony about the condition of Sade Robinson's remains. She stated that Robinson's leg was the first part of her body received by the medical examiner's office in April 2024.

Decker testified that a ""sharp instrument"" had been used to sever the leg, indicating intentional dismemberment. However, the most striking detail came from her analysis of the femur bone, which had been fractured through blunt force trauma.

She explained the femur—the longest and strongest bone in the human body—requires a significant amount of force to break. In a healthy young adult, such trauma would typically be seen in high-impact incidents, such as accidents.

Her testimony emphasized the violence of the act and added further weight to the prosecution's argument that Robinson's death was both brutal and intentional.

**Toxicology Report Shows No Substances of Abuse in Robinson's System**

Milwaukee County assistant medical examiner Dr. Lauren Decker, who oversaw Sade Robinson's autopsy testified that toxicology tests revealed no presence of alcohol, illegal drugs, or other substances of abuse in Robinson's system. The only substance detected was caffeine.

Decker explained that NMS Laboratories conducted testing on Robinson's leg muscle tissue, while the medical examiner's office also tested fluid from her heart. Both tests screened for hundreds of potential substances.

Although blood is typically the preferred sample for toxicology, Decker said muscle tissue remains a valid alternative—especially when blood is unavailable. At the time of testing, the medical examiner's office was uncertain whether they would ever receive a viable blood sample.

**Tenant Describes Unusual Quiet Night of April 1**

Maxwell Anderson's former tenant, whose identity is being withed at the request of prosecutors, testified that the home was uncharacteristically quiet on the evening of April, 1, 2024—the night prosecutors believe Sade Robinson was killed.

The tenant noted that Anderson was typically loud and active in the house. He frequently had guests over in the early morning hours and often used power tools for woodworking projects. However, on April 1, the tenant said he heard ""nothing"" which stood out given the usual noise levels.

Later that week, between 5 and 6 a.m. on an unspecified morning before the SWAT team raided the home on April 4, the tenant recalled hearing Anderson moving a heavy object down the stairs. He assumed it was  a suitcase and believed Anderson was preparing to leave town for a few days.

He emphasized that he did not hear any signs of struggle, screams, or the use of loud tools that night. ""I assure you if I had heard a power saw being used, I would have woken up immediately,"" he said, explaining he is a light sleeper.

The tenant also testified that he never noticed anything unusual in the basement during his time living there. He said that while the environment was noisy and chaotic, Anderson was lenient with rent, which he viewed as part of an unspoken exchange.

""It was a trade-off,"" he said. I knew I was living in a place I didn't want to live in because of how loud and disruptive it was. Max was going to do what Max was going to do.""

**Detective Recounts Surveillance and Arrest of Maxwell Anderson**

Just before the trial broke for lunch, Detective John Guillot of the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office took the stand to describe the events leading to the Maxwell Anderson arrest on April 4, 2024.

Guillot testified that he was conducting surveillance on Anderson's vehicle outside Victor's, a nightclub where Anderson worked, around 12:30 p.m. that day. He observed Anderson approaching the car wearing a black jacket, a knit hat, and a backpack. Guillot noted that the backpack appeared different from the one seen in surveillance footage dated April 1.

Detectives followed Anderson as he drove down West Clybourn Street, merged onto I-94 westbound and continued to West Lakefield Drive—just a few blocks from Anderson's then-residence.

""My whole goal at that point was not to let Mr. Anderson get back to his residence,"" Guillot said.

Officers initiated a traffic stop shortly after and ordered Anderson to exit the vehicle. Guillot stated that Anderson complied and was taken into custody without incident.

The trial is set to resume at 13:45 p.m. when Guillot will continue his testimony.

**Medical Examiner Testifies Robinson was Dismembered Postmortem**

Autopsy photos shown during Dr. Lauren Decker's testimony prompted several courtroom onlookers to wince or leave the gallery, as graphic images of Sade Robinson's severed leg, calf, and torso were displayed.

Dr. Decker Assistant Medical Examiner for Milwaukee County, testified that the right leg was brought to her office on April 2—the same day Robinson was reported missing. She said the cuts on the remains were smooth, indicating the use of a sharp instrument, and noted that a ""large amount of force"" would have been needed to penetrate the bone.

There was no evidence of natural disease or any medical condition that could explain Robinson's death. Crucially, Decker observed there was no bleeding from the wounds, suggesting that Robinson was already dead when she was dismembered.

""The presence of incised wounds would suggest this was intentional,"" she said.

As photos of Robinson's torso were displayed, several people in the courtroom exited. The torso was discovered with only the left arm and left breast still attached. Her head and neck have not been recovered—organs that Dr. Decker said would be critical in determining whether Robinson had been strangled.

Due to the condition of the remains, the medical examiner's office has not been able to identify an official cause of death. However, Decker noted that enough cardiac blood was collected from the torso to confirm the presence of caffeine in Robinson's system. No alcohol or drugs were detected.

**Detective: Robinson Planned to Meet Only Anderson on April 1**

Detective Matthew Vandertie of the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office testified that Sade Robinson was not arranging to meet with anyone other than Maxwell Anderson on April 1, 2024—the day prosecutors allege she was killed.

Vandertie said he reviewed Robinson's text messages from March 27 through April 3, 2024. His analysis showed no other conversations in which she planned to meet someone else that day. He also noted that none of the messages during that period were volatile, threatening, or referenced drug use.

The testimony was presented to reinforce the prosecution's timeline and to support their claim that Anderson was the last known person to have plans with Robinson before his disappearance.

**Waukegan Officer Testifies to Discovery of Human Arm on Lake Michigan Shore**

Officer Brooke Tavajian of the Waukegan Police Department testified that she was dispatched to the Lake Michigan shoreline on May, 11, 2024, following a report of a possible human arm found on the beach.

Tavajian said the location was difficult to access, situated far north along the shoreline. She was transported to the site by ATV.

Upon arrival, she observed a decayed and decomposing arm, which appeared discolored—a condition she noted was consistent with prolonged exposure to water. Tavajian told the court she believed the limb washed ashore from the lake.

**Body Cam Footage Shows 'Visibly Shaking' Anderson at Time of Arrest**

Jurors were shown body camera footage capturing the moment Maxwell Anderson was arrested by Milwaukee County Sheriff's detectives on April 4, 2024.

Detective John Gulliot testified that he and a partner were initially en route to Pizza Shuttle, where Sade Robinson worked, to conduct follow-up interviews when they spotted Anderson's black Hyundai Santa Fe parked outside of Victor's nigthclub—Anderson's former workplace in downtown Milwaukee.

""He was visibly shaking,"" Guillot told the court.

Anderson who was alone in the vehicle, was told he was being detained for a registration violation. Guillot emphasized that detectives did not mention Robinson's dissappearance at the time. Anderson complied with the stop and detectives seized his cellphone and wallet.

The black backpack Anderson had at the time of his arrest did not match the one he was seen carrying in bus surveillance footage taken near the location where Robinson's 2020 Honda was later found burned.

A sheriff's deputy at the scene captured the arrest on body camera, which was shown to the jury.

**Footage Shows Anderson and Robinson on First Date at Twisted Fisherman**

Following a brief break in proceedings, assistant district attorney Ian Vance-Curzan prevented several clips of Ring surveillance footage from Twisted Fisherman, documenting Sade Robinson's first and only date with Maxwell Anderson on April 1, 2024.

The footage showed Anderson arriving at the restaurant around 5:09 p.m. where he chatted with someone at the bar and ordered a beer. Robinson arrived about 10 minutes later, and the two sat together, ordered food, and later interacted with the bartender. At one point, all three took a shot together.

According to prosecutors, the pair had agreed to meet at Twisted Fisherman, located on West Canal Street, at Anderson's suggestion. He reportedly insisted on the location because he needed to retrieve a W-2 form from his prior employment there.

Robinson's family has since filed a lawsuit against Twisted Fisherman, LLC, and Duke's on Water, Inc., alleging negligence for serving alcohol to someone underage. The suit claims that the failture to check Robinson's ID left her vulnerable, impairing her ability to recognize danger or protect herself from harm.

During cross-examination of Detective John Guillot, defense attorney Anthony Cotton asked whether Robinson had been carded at the restaurant. After an objection from the prosecution, Judge Laura Crivello ruled that questions about underage drinking were not relevant to the case.

Surveillance footage indicated that Robinson consumed one drink and one shot, while Anderson had two drinks and one shot during their roughly hour-long stay. When offered a second shot, Robinson declined and the bartender gave it to Anderson. Before leaving, the pair took one final shot with the bartender around 6:20 p.m.

**Day 5 Concludes with Footage of Robinson and Anderson at Duke's on Water** 

The fifth day of testimony concluded with prosectuors presenting surveillance footage showing Sade Robinson and Maxwell Anderson at Duke's on Water, the second bar the two visited on April 1, 2024.

Milwaukee Police Detective Jake Puschnig testified that the pair arrived on Water Street around 6:30 p.m. in Robinson's Honda Civic before walking to the bar. Inside, they took two seats at the end of the bar, where they remained for the evening. 

Footage showed the two drinking throughout the night, with Anderson appearing to consume more alcohol, including additional shots. At one point, Anderson played a dice game with a nearby patron while Robinson looked on. Later, both participated in a game of beer pong with another couple.

At 8:30 p.m., Anderson stepped outside for a cigarette, according to surveillance video. By 9:03 p.m., he and Robinson were seen walking back toward her car. Footage showed Anderson briefly placing his arm around Robinson. They got into her vehicle a minute later.

Detective Puschnig noted that Robinson did not appear intoxicated or unsteady on her feet in any of the footage.

To close the day, prosecutors presented side-by-side comparisons of Anderson's mugshot, surveillance stills from an MCTS bus camera taken on April 2, and images of a man smoking outside Duke's on the night of April 1. Puschnig testified that all images were Maxwell Anderson.",38,50,2025-06-02 08:33:09,1l1i5ex,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1l1i5ex/maxwell_anderson_trial_in_milwaukee_day_5_updates/,milwaukee,restaurant_mention

Screaming Tuna Milwaukee,The Flood and Positive Role of MMSD in its Mitigation,"Based on all the data, it seems like this was one of if not the largest rain event in Southeast Wisconsin’s history.

It also seems likely that if MMSD hadn’t been preparing, building, and implementing green infrastructure for the last 30 years, it could have been much worse. In a world where Hart Park was still a neighborhood, the amount of catastrophic damage would have been disastrous. There have been some who’ve screamed that so much of what they’ve done was a waste, but in the light of all of this, that couldn’t be farther from the truth.

We need to recover. However, also, I think we need to be clear-eyed that this type of deluge will become more common as Milwaukee becomes rainier due to climate change. The work of MMSD is important. And their projects must move more quickly. 

Edit: MMSD refers to the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewer District ",1062,100,2025-08-11 08:43:26,1mndcjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1mndcjc/the_flood_and_positive_role_of_mmsd_in_its/,milwaukee,restaurant_mention

Screaming Tuna Milwaukee,"i need help potentially rehoming my recently adopted stray cat. please help me, i am distraught","hi there. i(21f) have a cat, papp(almost 2m according to the vet), that i have recently, and honestly quite impulsively taken in about 3 months ago. i want to give you a picture of my current situation, it's currently 6:30 am and i just rolled over to pick up my phone and write this, because i feel like am going insane.

in july of this year, my father unexpectedly passed away in an unfortunate accident where he drowned in the milwaukee river, it has left me heart broken as he was so spunky, lovely, full of life, and my twin. two days before he passed, this cat followed him home, and he was contemplating keeping him as he had a dog(who now went home with his parents, my paternal grandparents). i did not offer to take the cat at the time he was alive, came to meet the cat once the night before he passed, and after his passing decided to take the cat to get his shots and check for neutering. at the walk in vet they asked me to sign a form and it was an ownership form. and emotionally, for me, i couldn't let him go and i almost think i wanted to keep part of my dad alive. alright, now that i am done painting this pitiful pickle i have gotten myself into for you all, let me explain whats really bothering me.

i wake up probably 4 or 5 times a night from this cat. i feel like i'm going crazy, but he paces and often, which i know is typical with single cat homes, as they aren't as stimulated most of the time as two or multi-cat households. when he paces, he meows, and yowls at the walls, at nothing. the vet has confirmed he isn't in pain, and he's healthy. if i am going to be honest, he seems stressed.  he symmetrically grooms his belly, to the point his fur comes off, and his skin is not irritated. there are two dogs in the house but he gets along with them relatively well. he doesn't necessarily approach them but he's not mean either. but he keeps me up, he yowls, paces, grooms, and itches, constantly. it really truly feels like nothing is good enough for him.

he constantly tries to escape the house, and is successful at times. he usually comes home, and i've gotten him a tracker. i don't like him being outside and he really seems happier this way. but to be honest, i don't know if i can support that kind of outdoor lifestyle, i'm unemployed, i need to find a job and i want to start moving forward with my life. but this cat gives me crippling anxiety to move forward. i'm afraid ill be at work getting a call that he's escaped, or that he's going to keep being stressed, i don't know. i lose sleep over this.

essentially, i'm not totally 100% sure i can actually care for this cat. i have money, but not for long, and i don't think i'm making him happy, he doesn't seem interested in toys, nothing i buy him is good enough. i want him to be happy. should i be looking at potentially rehoming him? i've had him for about three months, and nurses him to a healthy weight and he's ready to go to a good home or property. i truly think he would thrive as a barn cat or something of that nature. he truly loves being outside. but here, he will get hit by a car. i don't wan't him to be stuck inside when he's been a stray or feral his whole life and is comfortable that way. i want to do what is best for him and also, what is best for me. i have been crying and thinking about this daily. i don't think i can handle caring for this cat much longer.

i feed him wet food 1-2x a day with water, and dry food twice a day. he has two water fountains, two cat towers, and free roam of the house. he still is stressed and wants to constantly go outside, bolts for the door if he hears it, paces constantly at night. i literally cover my ears because he meows constantly. i don't have any more money to spend at the vet, either. i've done what i can financially for him ): i just honestly don't think i have been able to truly grieve my father on my own, nor attempt to get my life on track because i simply so taken up trying to get the cat settled and happy so i can also start settling and be happy. 

tl dr; i have a new stray cat i have adopted from my late father, and he seems happier outdoors, and is pretty pent up and shows signs of stress and anxiety according to the vet. i am mentally drained because he walks around at 5 and 6 am every morning yowling and meowing, and oosing sleep from it. should i look at finding him a more suitable home with someone who is more mentally, and financially stable? i am a mess about this. please give me your best possible advice, and i'm also preared to be told i'm an idiot for adoption a stray cat my late dad rescued.

(sorry this is like my first actual post. i'm just so lost and this situation his eating me alive. i want to vomit at the thought that i might cause him even more stress. i just don't know what to do, he's still pacing and meowing as i'm typing the end of this. i want to scream and cry because i get like, five hours of sleep a night some nights)",22,58,2025-11-01 07:43:09,1olmuy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1olmuy6/i_need_help_potentially_rehoming_my_recently/,milwaukee,restaurant_mention

I completely understand that many people with 9-5 jobs have trouble attending events during the day. However, after hosting this event, I’ve found that the morning timing really helps create a specific energy. It’s about starting the day with a sense of release and empowerment, and the early morning vibe is integral to what we’re creating together. The stillness and focus of the morning seem to resonate deeply with those who attend, and I personally find it to be the most transformative time to gather in this way.

I truly encourage you to think about how you could make space for this experience, whether that means adjusting your schedule just once or planning your morning around this unique release. There’s something special about connecting with others in this way before diving into the demands of the day. If you’ve been curious about it, I really believe it’s worth making time for, and I’d love to see you there!",0,51,2025-10-09 14:09:01,1o2ev2z,https://i.redd.it/zyk1ivp5w4uf1.png,milwaukee,restaurant_mention

La Dama | Mexican Kitchen & Bar,Sinabro & Maru Korean Bistro,"As someone who knows a friend that used to  works at both places, just letting everyone know that they are both owned by the same Korean family. They have the same recipes & most of the same menu/dishes. Just Sinabro has a bar & dessert options. Maru shorted their menu over time due to only 1 chef. At Maru whatever server you see is working that day, they also have to help prep/make food. Think of the delivery orders and Togo. Sometimes other sides as well. They have to constantly go back to the kitchen to help otherwise they’ll be in trouble. Even if it means the dine in must wait a bit until their return from the kitchen. Sinabro also does something similar to this. Now if you’re wondering why are they both always short staffed? I believe both establishments don’t want to book more servers on certain days to save money paying employees and have them work scattered around. These restaurants only pay their employees minimum wage which is $3. Now if you’re wondering why aren’t there many Koreans working as servers? Well easy answer is there’s not many Koreans in Milwaukee. The few that are here are most likely not going to work a minimum wage job that has to handle stressful situations, not so great management, and food industry. Koreans like to play favorites, same goes for their employees. If you notice a particular one constantly having to do something… might not be their favorite and had to deal with that fact. These restaurants also end up having staff leaving. If you think you have a favorite server… guess what? He or she might end up quitting due to their bad management. These servers get yelled at even at times where they aren’t at fault. The mistreatment shouldn’t even happen. Please treat servers of any kind like a good human being while they still work at these places. These are mostly young teenagers to college students who would work at these kind of places trying to make money for their families or education. And I hope they find better careers too like my friend who got out.

Michael’s Family Restaurant,Restaurant recommendations for family with disparate dietary needs,"My fiance and I are getting married soonish and are looking for a restaurant to host about 12 family members at a local restaurant for a meal, and I would love to find a place that suits most of the dietary needs/quirks of them...

1. Two have fish/shellfish allergies
2. One pescatarian (they will also happily eat vegetarian dishes)
3. Some have mushroom allergies
4. One with a severe aversion to vegetables 
5. My quirk is that I like good ingredients prepared well
6. One with a severe aversion to sauces and no spicy cuisines
7. One cranky old meat and potatoes dad

We (fiance and I) would like somewhere with some ambiance. I am hoping to find somewhere for less than $50 per plate. The day is flexible (Friday or Saturday), as is the date, so we have time to make a reservation. Any recommendations would be welcome. 

Edited to add that the allergies aren't life-threatening. They just can't eat the allergens.",0,38,2025-09-07 21:11:24,1nbbmyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1nbbmyj/restaurant_recommendations_for_family_with/,milwaukee,restaurant_mention
Michael’s Family Restaurant,Authentic Chinese restaurant for picky family?,"Having family visiting from up north, past Wausau north. It's CNY and I would like to show them Chinese food they can't find at a take out spot. The problem is they have zero spice tolerance and can be picky. I'm worried I'll just be buying expensive panda express. One said ""I can't do seasoned or spicy"" and got excited for broccoli beef. Maybe this is an impossible task?

My initial thought process was someplace with different menus so at I could enjoy something like mapo tofu. Sze chuan is my go to and they have stuff like broccoli beef, but it feels wrong getting that there. I've been recommended Fortune and Jings, but I haven't been to those.

My family and I have been doing a series of dinners this year, where we have a sit down meal at a non-chain restaurant with each successive place beginning with a different letter of the alphabet. We recently moved to Milwaukee (Shorewood to be exact) and were looking to continue our series. 

We’re on N, so we’re looking for suggestions! Family-friendly is a bonus, but our kids (11 and 9) don’t limit themselves to the children’s menu so we’re really after more interesting, local places that show off Milwaukee.

Michael’s Family Restaurant,RANT: Kopp's needs to fix their online ordering system,"So today at Kopp's, they have one of my family's favorite flavors, Spumoni. I know it's pretty popular in general and the Kopp's on 76th and Layton in Greenfield is usually busy on Sunday, so I placed an order online with their relatively new app for 2 pints and a double scoop dish to be picked up 30 minutes from ordering.

I got there 5 minutes before the time I set the order at and asked at the pick-up counter how they call out online orders. I was told I had to wait in line (there were about 10 people already in it) to ""check-in"" and then they'd call it. I was annoyed but figured this was maybe just a formality and since I ordered just custard, it could be in the freezer waiting for me to check-in. I finally get to the cashiers and say I want to check in for my online order. He randomly switches to a different register to do this, takes the ticket, and hands it to the back and doesn't look at me or acknowledge me afterwards. I don't have a number or anything or told how long it will take. It takes an additional 10+ minutes after checking in to be called, and even then, I have to wait for them to get my dish because they have to ask if I want it open or closed and what order I want my scoops in (gee, if only there was an online ordering system where these questions could be specified). Since the custard side is the busiest side, I have to wait an additional 3 minutes.

What is the point of being able to designate what time you will pick it up if you still have to wait in line for them to even start your order? Is it really that hard to implement a system for picking up online orders that's separate from the normal ordering process? I love Kopp's and I've never had a problem with service as far as employees being rude or anything, but this just totally turned me off of going there more often. Ordering ahead is a benefit for both the customer (being able to time it to your liking) and the restaurant (not having to waste manpower and other customer's time taking an order).

We need some information to help us understand the vibe of these suburbs. 
Here is a little about us
- we are a South Asian family and would prefer some diversity and where we won't face racism. Where our child can feel included. We currently live in a very very diverse area and love it. Not to mention all the awesome restaurants due to it 
- schools which provide good services for special needs children 
- we come from a state that leans to one party by a wide margin and we would prefer somewhere where politics is not in our face and is more balanced and civil. 
- we prefer more simple neighborhoods where it is not about what you wear, who you know or what car you drive.

Michael’s Family Restaurant,Moving to Milwaukee - Seeking Advice,"I searched this subreddit for similar threads, and didn't find any answers that applied to my exact situation, so I'd really appreciate your insight on this.

I just got a job offer in Milwaukee starting at 65k. Most of the housing I've seen on Zillow is really affordable compared to where I'm moving from. A family member told me that a lot of the residential areas in Milwaukee near my job aren't safe to live in. The job is in the southern end of the city, near the airport. Do you agree with her opinion?

I'm a single young man, I have no pets, I'm healthy and I own my car outright. I pay about $200 a month in student loans, and they should be done in the next year. I have good credit, landlord references and no criminal recors. I am looking for housing with no roommates, although sharing a building is fine. Do you have any recommendations about what neighborhoods I should look at, and why? I specifically would like a short commute to South Milwaukee and a safe place to live with nice amenities like public transit, restaurants, bars, parks and concert venues. Being near the lake is also a plus for me. I do not value the quality of local schools or child care. I'm not looking for suburban areas - I'd prefer to walk, bike, or take public transit whenever possible. Unfortunately I have to drive to my job for appearances sake.

If this all sounds like a pipe dream, I haven't accepted the job yet, so that is also an option. Besides housing, I'm also open to any other advice or opinions about moving to Milwaukee.

Michael’s Family Restaurant,Place to host 3yo Kid’s Birthday Party,"Hi All,

My wife and I are in a scramble to find a place to host our kids’ birthday next month. 

We’re trying to find somewhere to accommodate roughly 20 people - a few of their friends, but mostly family that’s coming from out of town.

Our house is too small to host, and despite our mild fall thus far, we fear winter will mean we can’t host outdoors. We’re looking at indoor park shelters, kids’ activity places and restaurants trying to find something reasonable, but we’re getting priced out. A lot of the kid-centric spots are expensive and would go unused by the majority of the adults. Others are too advanced for a 3yo. We’d honestly be fine with a plain room somewhere as long we could set up some decor and activities for the kids. 

Our budget is under $400 for the space, ideally we’d save on the space and be able to spend more on food. Do any restaurants offer private spaces if you hit a food minimum?

Michael’s Family Restaurant,Missing people of Milwaukee with addresses and links,"Despite having only 222 missing adults and 32 children on national databases NamUs and NCMEC, Milwaukee ALONE has [over 500 missing people at any time](https://mediamilwaukee.com/special-projects/missing-in-milwaukee/). Every one of these (the reported missings, not the full 500+) is updated by me daily on my website which I make no money from and only post here for your information. [Wismissing.com](https://www.wismissing.com/)

The laws and procedures in Wisconsin do not require reporting missing people to these databases. Therefore, the true epidemic of missing people is misunderstood as even news sources misreport the number. Unfortunately, MKE PD is critically understaffed. More importantly, the standards of operation rules for MKE PD to report to the news about missing persons ONLY about critical missing, which are generally children under 11 or adults 60 and older, people in immediate harm or those with cognitive disability. [Source](https://city.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/Groups/mpdAuthors/SOP/180-MISSINGPERSONS1.pdf). If your missing person doesn’t fit that criteria, they will not be referred to the news media from MKE pd. Most missing people do not fit these criteria.

I do not have access to the full list of missing people – only the police have that. These are some of the cold case people from the Milwaukee County area – also a few newer ones. I am only including ones that have address information available.  These all deserve attention for the sake of the families. I've listed them below, also a link to a page with more information for each. Please keep on the lookout for them as well as evidence of them. I am doing this to help these families get some closure, so please don’t downvote.

MKE’s own ACE/Freight Runners is doing the dirty work of moving people away from their families and legal support networks. Please let them know what you think about that. 

Original post from Saturday:

Got a call from activists about buses leaving ICE detention facility - recently filled with people snatched out of courthouses and local businesses - and pulling into Burbank airport. They used the western service entrance at Clyborne and Sherman, nearest to Million Air charter services (who had absolutely nothing to do with this) and loaded people into two charter planes marked with the Air Charter Express logo. Their website is www.freightrunners.com, if you’re interested.

While Trump and Musk turn on each other like a couple of high school sophomores, their human rights abuses are stepping up and into our community.

Keep boycotting Avelo. But now we have a second fascist profiteer to deal with. I feel sick. Due process is a goddamned human right.",0,20,2025-06-08 15:19:41,1l6ltz4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l6ltz4,milwaukee,restaurant_mention
Michael’s Family Restaurant,Prosecutors Detail Final Hours of Sade Robinson in Day 2 of Trial,"**Note:** This post is intended to share information from publicly available reporting on the Maxwell Anderson trial in Milwaukee. It is meant to inform and provide space for thoughtful, respectful discussion about the case. Please keep comments civil and sensitive to the nature of the topic and those impacted.

**Content Warning:** This post contains descriptions of violence and graphic forensic details from an ongoing murder trial. Reader description is advised. The defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty in a court of law.

In a case that has drawn intense public attention, across Milwaukee and beyond, **Maxwell Anderson,** 34, is on the trial for the **murder and dismemberment of 19-year-old Sade Robinson** after what began as a first date in April 2024. The second day of testimony offered jurors a detailed and disturbing timeline built from text messages, phone tracking data, surveillance footage, and forensic evidence. Prosecutors painted a chilling picture of Robinson's final hours, while the defense began to question the reliability of the technology and evidence used to tell that story.

Here's a full breakdown of the key developments from **Day 2** of the trial: 

**Text Messages & Location Data:** 

Jurors reviewed Robinson's final messages, including one asking Anderson if he was inside the restaurant they planned to meet at. Using Life360 and Verizon location data, detectives tracked her movements from the dinner date to Anderson's residence. Her phone stayed there for several hours before it began moving again shortly after midnight. 

**Defense Challenges Cellphone Evidence:** 

Defense attorney Jason Findling pushed back on this digital timeline, questioning whether Robinson's phone was actually close enough to the relevant cell towers to produce accurate location data. He pressed Matthew Vandertie on the limits of this technology, attempting to undermine a cornerstone of the prosecutions case. 

**Crime Scene & Forensic Evidence:**

Robinson’s severed leg was discovered April 2 on a beach at Warnimont Park. A city access gate had been forcefully breached, and broken car parts matching Robinson’s Honda Civic were recovered nearby. Investigators testified the leg was intentionally severed, with clean, smooth cuts consistent with the use of a tool. Weather conditions on the day—cold, rainy, and windy—complicated access to the site.

**Photos & Evidence from Anderson’s Phone:**

Police found disturbing images on Anderson’s phone, including one showing Robinson facedown on a couch, his hand grabbing her body. Her clothing from that night, confirmed by surveillance footage, was later found in the trunk of her burned vehicle

**Grim Revelation in Court:**

For the first time, the prosecution revealed that Robinson had been intentionally decapitated. Some of her remains are still missing. The announcement prompted audible gasps in the courtroom.

**Surveilance & Timeline Reconstruction:**

Prosecutors walked the jury through hours of surveillance footage and phone data. Video from a home across the street captured activity in Anderson’s residence after Robinson arrived. By 12:45 a.m., her phone—and her car—began moving through Milwaukee, stopping in several neighborhoods before ending at Warnimont Park.

Jurors also reviewed grainy and low-light surveillance footage from near the Cudahy lakefront, shown by Milwaukee County Sheriff's  Detective Nathan Spittlemeister. The videos depict a dark sedan traveling through the area, including near the pump house at Wairmont Park, from approximately 2:30 to 4:45 a.m. on April 2. One camera briefly captures what appears to be a human figure walking down a bluff toward the lake before disappearing into the tree line.

**Witness and Officer Testimony:**

 Eyewitness Osyrus Terrell testified he found the leg while walking on a narrow path. Officers described the leg as appearing recently placed, with pink toenail polish and minimal blood. A Cudahy city official confirmed the park’s entry gate had been intact the night before it was found broken.

**Defense Argument:**

Anderson’s attorneys argue there’s no direct physical evidence linking him to Robinson’s death—no murder weapon, no internet searches, and no DNA at the scene. They say the state’s theory relies too heavily on circumstantial evidence.

**Family in Court**

Sade Robinson’s mother, Sheena Scarbrough, sat in the front row, surrounded by family. Their quiet presence added emotional weight to the day’s proceedings.

The trial is expected to continue into next week. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel is live-streaming coverage daily on JSOnline and YouTube.

What are your thoughts on the prosecution’s timeline and the defense’s challenge to the evidence? Please keep this thread respectful for the sake of the victim’s family and all those impacted.

Michael’s Family Restaurant,Neighborhood Recommendations for Single-Family Homes,"Hi!

My wife and I are moving to Milwaukee in the next few months and are currently looking for a rental. We're hoping to move into a single-family home with a yard for our dogs. We know almost nothing about the city, and even less about the neighborhoods, and are hoping for a little help!

I will be working at MCW, and my wife may be working in Brown Deer. Ideally we both have <30 minute commute. We don't necessarily need to be in a happening neighborhood. No kids so schooling zones are not a concern. Our budget is around $2500-2700/month. If you're able, we'd love help answering the following:

1. What neighborhoods could we center our search around, and any places we should avoid looking at?
2. Any realtor services that you could recommend that may help us (Currently looking at Zillow, Apartments dot com, Realtor dot com, Redfin)?

I’m currently looking for a new opportunity outside of Tosa as either a Host or Foodrunner and was hoping to get some insights from others in the industry. My biggest priority is finding a restaurant with a management team that values and supports its employees—something I experienced at Blackshoe Hospitality, where they treated me like family.

I’ve been looking into a few places, such as Café Corazon, but I’ve heard some mixed reviews about the management there, which has made me a bit tentative about following up. I know it can be tough to find the perfect fit, but I’m hopeful there’s a place out there where I can work with a solid, caring team.

Blue Star Cafe,Thank you Milwaukee for the amazing Labor Day weekend visit!,"So impressed and absolutely smitten with my return visit to Milwaukee. Ever since a three day trip in 2019 I've been dreaming of a return to Milwaukee and have even purchased and read several books by John Gurda (Cream City Chronicles, The Making of Milwaukee, and Milwaukee: A City Built on Water) to build up anticipation for a return trip. I finally made it happen last holiday weekend with a solo trip from Saturday - Tuesday and stayed in the charming Riverwest neighborhood. 

Flew from Richmond where I live too Chicago then took the train up and was warmly and to my glee welcomed by the phenomenal Third Ward Arts Festival on Saturday on a beautiful sunny day. From then on it was nonstop adventure and good times in the Cream City. Made my way to Riverwest to unpack and spent the rest of the trip on foot, bus, and streetcar. On Saturday I walked over to the gorgeous Oriential Theatre to catch a movie (I'm a huge cinephile so this was a must). Sunday was very busy with a walk from Riverwest to North Point then down Prospect Ave all the way to downtown, caught the bus, then did a phenomenal tour of the Pabst Mansion. From there I walked and marveled at the Victorian duplexes and homes along Avenues West, briefly stopped at the new Harley-Davidson Park, and walked from there to a tour of Miller Brewing. Feeling boozy and feet tired I hopped on a bus to Wauwatosa for dinner and feeling extra adventurous took the bus all the way out to Eckbar in West Allis. Great place 👌 

Monday I grabbed a delicious breakfast at Beerline Cafe and walked along the Milwaukee River to Brewers Hill (def my most favorite neighborhood) where I did some exploring (I believe I was able to track down four tied houses related to Blatz, Schlitz, and Pabst by the end of the trip across Milwaukee County), stopped at Schlitz Park, and walked to the Art Museum. Feeling tired I finally rode the streetcar and connected to the bus to Walkers Point for a stop at Indeed Brewing. From there took the bus Monday night to one more suburb (Shorewood) and hit Hubbard Park Beer Garden before somehow finding the energy to walk back to Riverwest at 9 PM along the Oak Leaf Trail lol. Tuesday was spent exploring the Brewery District, Brady Street (Glorioso's omg wow), North Point mansions and downtown before catching the train back to Chicago that evening. All I can say is it was such a great visit. As someone who grew up in Savannah and lived in Richmond's Fan District with an appreciation for historic architecture and great neighborhoods (and loves beer too), I absolutely was blown away by the historic architecture, neighborhood vibes, ease of getting around on foot and bus, and interesting multicultural history of Milwaukee built by waves of immigration. Thank you Milwaukee for the good times, I shall return!

Blue Star Cafe,R.I.P. Fuel Cafe.,"Some time around ‘93, as we left an all ages show (probably Citizen King, Little Blue Crunchy Things, Alligator Gun, or The Pacers), someone said they knew of a cafe that was open late and would let us smoke. We turned off Humboldt onto Center Street and Fuel was the only thing lit up, like a beacon in the night. The love affair began. 

So many days spent just sitting there. It was the first place I learned to be alone. But so many memories of friends, too. 

5th Street never lived up. It’d do, but it was often a little sad.

Blue Star Cafe,Restaurants with Kids,"Will be in town the next couple days from Madison with our two young kids (3-6 age range). Spouse and I haven't gotten to explore the area much and are struggling to pick where to eat. We will be staying in the Shorewood area but will be going down to Grant Park and coming in by Mitchell Domes. Looking for best recs on where to eat that are appropriate to bring kids but not kid-centric if that makes sense. I've seen recs for AJ Bombers, Kopps, etc. and we'll probably do one of those but also interested in great places adults like. Super fancy romantic, Michelin star type places are probably out but looking for that in-between where we can have great food without an arcade in the background or patrons glaring at us for bringing kids.

 If they don't have a kid's menu, that's fine! We like all types of cuisine, nothing too spicy, no dietary restrictions. Some of our faves in Madison are Tipsy Cow, Muramoto, Tornado Room (without kids), Cento/Naples 15, and Mint Mark (would LOVE to try a Milwaukee equivalent of that!).  Especially looking for dinner recs but breakfast/brunch welcome too!


EDIT: Coming back post trip to say thank you for all the fantastic recommendations! For future parents reading this - here is what we ened up doing

3rd St Market Hall on the way in (fast, tasty options, enclosed play pen area right in front of the cheeseburger place). We did sushi and partner did something southern/ribs type. Both good.

Kopps for custard - pretty tasty, both kids claim they still like Culver's better and I have to agree. I think it needed just a bit of salt.

Breakfast at Brewer's Hill Wolfies. Food was good but wait ended up being over an hour (originally to be 30 min) + wait on food mix-up. Had to split up and deal with melting down child elsewhere. 

Lunch at Public market - kids devoured a smoothie and ice cream. 

Carryout from La Merenda shout out to /u/prelawpup for that one. Fantastic food. Kids at pretty much none of it but we loved it and loved that we could do carryout! My fave was the gnocchi and Kung Pao beef. 

Breakfast from The City Market Cafe. Really good coffee, pastries, fast. Egg sandwich was just ok, imo. I wanted to try Seven Swans Creperie but after another meltdown put us late getting out the door, it was a 30 min wait so I'm still very sad we didn't get to try that one.

We went to the Zocalo Food Trucks on the way out and I'd do that again, 100%. Had delicious pizza, tacos, kids had ice cream again. There were several other options I would have loved to try. Nice space for kids to get wiggles out and safely explore. 

Still have a bunch of options we'd love to try, plus we need to the beach in temps warmer than 62F, so we'll be back!",0,45,2025-05-21 10:24:25,1ks0loy,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1ks0loy/restaurants_with_kids/,milwaukee,restaurant_mention

Harbor House,It can’t be understated what a massive flooding event hit us last weekend.,"I’m someone that goes on runs/hikes/fishes along our rivers here in SE Wisconsin. Almost every month since this beautiful city has been my home. Never in my time here have I seen the river system remotely close to this. It’s hard to grasp how much water truly fell upon us.

I know there’s a lot of people hurting. Here in this sub, the neighbors I’ve talked to, the stories I’ve read. The streets with garbage piled up in front yards from flooded basements has brought tears to my eyes. I empathize and feel for you, I’m so sorry and what a terrible thing to deal with. I know there’s a lot of property damage and despair. I’m hoping we can build back in an extraordinary way together.

A few takeaways: 

I believe the metropolitan area did a phenomenal job preparing for something like this. While not perfect! The deep tunnel project spanning decades made a fucking difference, flood risk reduction projects like hart park, doyne park, etc is a positive step to protect our infrastructure. We didn’t have any widespread deaths or injuries. Let’s celebrate these things.

There’s been a lot of other flood mitigation projects from MMSD. Check out their website to see the good work they’re doing.

It takes all of us to see the positive change in our cities. I’ve seen so many storm drains clogged with debris. There’s always been trash on the river banks even BEFORE this event. Last weekend will only exacerbate the problem!

If you have some time this weekend or in the coming months grab a pair of gloves and a garbage bag and go down to your local section of river, the harbor, your friends or families house who was hit harder than you. 
You don’t need to donate money to make a difference. 

I love Milwaukee and SE Wisconsin because of the generous, caring, compassionate community we have. If you’re like me and were fortunate enough to not be impacted by the flooding. Now’s the time to lend a helping hand.

Would love any recommendations for anything, including driving schools if anyone has recently crossed that bridge. 
Definitely a decision to not be in downtown, but I’m close enough to Uber I guess

Things besides me just being new in town:
Love being outside and walking cities (love to find some walking tours of mke)
Fan of nature
Into cooking
Looking forward to live music in the city

I moved here less than a year ago but haven’t had much of a chance to explore—between starting a new job and the unexpected loss of all four of my grandparents shortly after moving, it’s been a chaotic 9 months. I also haven’t met many people/made really any friends yet because I’ve just been focusing on my new job and processing, so I figured this might be the best place to turn for some ideas.

We already have tickets to the Bucks game, and I’m planning to take him vintage and thrift shopping because that’s totally his thing (he’s been collecting for a couple of years now since he is opening his own vintage mall). He’s also a musician so music related suggestions are welcome!

We both live to eat, so any restaurant suggestions would be amazing. I’m also totally open to day trips (within an hour or so of the city), if there’s anything worth the drive.

Anything helps — Thanks in advance!

The Edison,$300 parking citation. Advice needed,"Hi all, last night I went to a show at Turner Hall. I parked in front of 1232 N Edison st around 7:30 pm just past a sign that said “2 HR parking 7-7 except Sunday”. The first picture is the exact stall I parked in. There was a car behind me, then behind that was a loading zone until 7 pm with about six motorcycles in it.

I came out after the show and had gotten a $150 ticket for “street clearing”. The street perpendicular to me was closed (this is near water street) but the particular street I was on was not closed and was completely parked with cars.

I went to contest it last night and the city website is showing two identical tickets for $150 at the same time for the same thing, just different citation numbers. I looked up the parking restrictions for the 1200 block of N Edison and it confirms exactly the sign I and my friend saw. I was not in a driveway.

What chance do I have at contesting this? I have literally never gotten a parking ticket before. Would I be better off calling than disputing online?

Oak Barrel Public House,DO NOT SUPPORT OAK BARREL PUBLIC HOUSE,"The food is overrated, overpriced, and undercooked. They are rude to their staff, they are manipulative and full of empty promises. They cannot keep employees because they treat them like garbage. They’re selfish and don’t care about anyone but themselves. The management is unstable, the kitchen is overworked and it shows, and they take money out of peoples pockets yet act cheap. The owners wife is HR and it’s full of bias. 

Here’s a rundown: 
I was a server/bartender there since May. Since I started, there were only 3 people that have been there longer than 4 months. It started out great, I loved my job, then management changed. Everything changed. Not an ounce of consistency. It’s a restaurant, there’s NEVER going to be that much of it, but with new management their numbers may have went up but their staff is unhappy and the reviews have gotten worse. 

The new GM, David, was very kind at first and understanding. I was going through a lot at the time, and I had to move back home for a month, and he was thrilled to have me back because EYE begged to come back. It was my first job since moving to Milwaukee so it had a special place in my heart and I loved my coworkers. He put me on a pedestal when I returned because “i was the only one who actually wanted to work” huh. So I came back and worked 6 days a week because I was promised I wouldn’t need another job. 

Fast forward 2 months, I’ve become a server trainer along with two of my other friends, the two who have been there for over a year. We had high expectations of course, we have to set the example. We were making $2.33 an hour, but after several weeks of “your training never ends” we were able to get the GM to let us always clock in at $7.25. Since “training never ends.” Checks out. We were getting the benefits, so we held up our end.

Fast forward another 2 months, toast had an audit. For some reason, our staff was missing hundreds of our tips out of a paycheck. The owner and his wife fixed this, they spent all night going through everyone’s hours and wrote checks to make up for it. By doing that, the owner said “why are these trainers clocked in as trainers but there are no trainees?”
That’s right! Clearly the GM did not relay the message. So after 2 months, we had to start clocking back in at 2.33. This became a problem because my difference in my monthly pay was around $1300. $1300 that I no longer have. They expected us to continue to bend over backwards for them, hold up expectations, and continue the work we were doing. 

We’re told to hold out, be patient, it’s bucks season. They hired too many servers, and suddenly were losing our sections and our hours. Not a single server was making close to what they should. Now we’re not making our rent, no $ for groceries, so the bare minimum we were asking for was a free kids meal on our shift. Not a $20 entree. A $9 meal. People are getting fired left and right for eating food and it’s fair, yes that’s stealing, so they said to start ringing it in at least so inventory matched up. Fair. 
Then it became a problem. Now we’re in a time that we have all been applying to over 50 jobs but no one is hiring. We’ve become stuck and bills keep piling AND we can’t even eat. 
They took away our voiding and comping codes, because the most random servers had manager codes. 

My GM offered to help me and lend me a small amount so I could make rent. He did not follow through. That’s okay, so I asked him if I could have a free kids meal at least. He said no.

Two days ago, myself and my other trainer got fired over a $4 comp of a burger from well before the new rules went into effect. Something so small right? Or is it because we kept asking when they were going to give us the $5 raise they promised for a month? 

This is all while the GM threatens the staff how he wishes that he could hire all new staff and how we’re incompetent and he sure did treat us like such with rude comments and other threats of scheduling. 

If they don’t care about their staff, what makes you think they care about their customers? They lie, make empty promises, they purposely up charge, and the entire place is dirty. 

Don’t support this establishment, and definitely, DO NOT work there.

Oak Barrel Public House,Brunch near Fiserv.forum? Oak Barrel Public House?,"We have a Marquette graduation next Saturday at the [Fiserv.forum](http://Fiserv.forum) at 1 pm and would like to do a brunch for 7 beforehand. Somewhere close enough so we can park and walk to brunch and head back when it's time. 

I'm eyeing Oak Barrel Public House just blocks away. They claim to have brunch but the menu just lists breakfast food and mimosas. We don't need to drink before the gradualtion so I don't care about that. They have a nice enough looking breakfast menu, though I always thought brunch was kind of a buffet type setup. If it's good I don't really care. 

Opinions on this or other ideas please?

Oak Barrel Public House,Last day to send a comment on WE Energies raising our rates even more,"WE is trying to build new methane gas plants, which based on how our bills work, would be used to justify jacking up our rates. They are already seeking to hike our rates for each of the next several years, and this would be additional ""cost of capital"" used to justify increases on top of that. And this has been hypothesized to largely be for the Microsoft data center, which Microsoft has already announced a pause to. 



1100 MW gas plant 
https://apps.psc.wi.gov/ERF/ERF/comment/filecomment.aspx?util=6630&case=CE



Methane storage facility 
https://apps.psc.wi.gov/ERF/ERF/comment/filecomment.aspx?util=6630&case=CG&num=140



That is especially burdensome considering the risk that these plants may become stranded assets. We Energies, the most profitable utility in Wisconsin, is still collecting about $650 million from plants which won't produce any power. These became a stranded asset and left customers on the hook for rising electricity rates. Imagine moving out of a house and being stuck with the mortgage for another 15 years. WE Energies has requested significant rate hikes for 2025 and 2026. The total requested increase for electricity bills is $418.8 million over two years (methane gas is almost 200 million on top of this), which translates to an 18.5% increase for residential customers. Of course, us residential customers have been footing more of the increases than the commercial customers. 

 The health costs alone associated with these impacts are estimated to be around $120 million dollars, annually. Southeastern Wisconsin, including Milwaukee and Kenosha counties, already struggles with air quality issues. The new plant would worsen these conditions, leading to more emergency room visits and health problems. For some reason, the Public Service Commision has allowed for no environmental study be done on the proposed plant, even though they required it for other less polluting plants proposed in the state.

Mediterranean cuisine,Thoughts on Mediterranean Cuisine Milwaukee? Planning a get-together.,"Hey! I'm planning a little get-together with some of my high school friends, probably around 8 to 10 of us, and we’re thinking about going to Mediterranean Cuisine in Milwaukee. I haven’t been there myself, so I was wondering if anyone here has tried it and could share their thoughts. Is it a good spot for a group? How’s the food overall? I’ve heard the kebabs and gyro are popular, but I’m open to other suggestions too. We’re mostly looking for a chill place with good food and decent service. Do they have enough space to handle a group that size comfortably? And is it better to go at a certain time to avoid a wait? Any tips or recommendations would be super helpful.

Buckley's Restaurant & Bar,The Third Ward becomes Hollywood!,"This summer will be 35 years since the Third Ward was turned into the backdrop for DILLINGER, starring Mark Harmon. I shared a studio in the Marshall Building with 2 other illustrators at the time and we spent a lot of time watching the action. 320 E Buffalo was dressed up as the Biograph, and I remember watching the night they gunned down Mark Harmon in the street. A couple of scenes were shot at the Broadway Bar & Grill at 221 Broadway. I think it was the only restaurant in the Third Ward back then. There was also a big bank robbery scene shot in the ornate lobby on the Wisconsin Electric Power Co at 231 W Michigan. Here are some of the photos I shot that summer. You can still see the movie on YouTube, link below. Unfortunately it wasn't a very good movie, but the fun was just seeing Milwaukee in the background.

The Wicked Hop,Two random Swedes are back home. Thank you Milwaukee!,"So. We are back home, jetlagged and happy.

Since you guys truly opened your subreddit, heart and city for us, we thought we'd give you some details about what actually happened to us. Did we get out on the water? Did we enjoy Milwaukee?

We flew in to Chicago and got to our rental car, which happened to be a brand new Jeep Wrangler. We've driven quite a lot in the States but holy cow are you Wisconsinites in a hurry. Driving 10 MPH over the speed limit and we were still always the slowest car on the road. Some butt clenching moments were had.

We had booked an AirBnb and stayed in The Malt House. A really cool apartment house full of Pabst history and Central Waters Brewery and OnTap right outside the door. It was dirt cheap for some reason. We paid about $90 per night for a 2 bed room apartment with all the bells and whistles. We had e few beers and our first Cheese Curds, which we loved, and took an early night.

The next day we walked around Milwaukee and happened to stroll right by BMO Pavilion as The Red Clay Strays did their sound check. It sounded awsome so when we got back to the AirBnb we listned some more as we'd never heard of them before. Took us one song to decide to book tickets.

At the concert we met so many wonderful people. In the row behind us were four of the most fantasic people we've ever met, it took them all about 10 seconds to proclaim ""We are going to take care of you guys"". And boy did they.. They took us to the Public Market Tikihut after the concert and the evening ended with dancing in The Wicked Hop until it closed. To top an amazing night off, they invited us to Kenosha to go out on the lake with their boat. We accepted without hesitation. Some time later we headed out to Kenosha and had an absolute blast on the waters. Live music, wake surfing, swimming. A day I will remember and cherrish til the day I die. We didn't fish, but we couldn't have cared less. This was way better than fishing.

This is pretty much how our trip carried on. Minus some days with runny noses and a couple of days with shopping.

Everyone thought we were crazy for coming to Milwaukee on vacation. We disagree. We love your city. Everyone was so warm and welcoming. Incredible hospitality. We have only positive things to say about our trip. We have made life long friends. You should feel proud.

Hoping you guys are okay eventhough you've had the rainfall of a century.

Thank you Milwaukee!",1137,54,2025-08-10 16:52:53,1mmv9sq,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1mmv9sq/two_random_swedes_are_back_home_thank_you/,milwaukee,restaurant_mention

It is meant to inform and provide space for thoughtful, respectful discussion about the case. Please keep comments civil and sensitive to the nature of the topic and those impacted.

**Content Warning:** This post contains descriptions of violence and graphic forensic details from an ongoing murder trial. Reader discretion is advised. The defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty in a court of law.

*Last Updated: 17:42 p.m. CST — June 05, 2025. This post will continue to be updated throughout the day as new information becomes available.*

**Anderson’s Ex-Girlfriend Testifies to Secretive Behavior and Emotional Abuse**

On the stand Thursday, Maxwell Anderson’s former girlfriend described him as “emotionally abusive” and “secretive” during their nearly year-long relationship from May 2022 to March 2023. The woman, whose identity was withheld by court order, said she frequently visited Anderson’s home on Milwaukee’s south side and recounted a pattern of controlling behavior.

Much of her testimony focused on a location Anderson once referred to as a “secret beach,” which she later identified as Warnimont Park, the site where the first remains of Sade Robinson were found in April 2024.

While she testified that Anderson never physically harmed her, she described emotional manipulation and referenced an incident in which Anderson got into a fistfight with her former boyfriend on St. Patrick’s Day in 2022.

She also noted unusual features inside Anderson’s home, including “myriad hidden compartments” and a false-bottom drawer beneath the bathroom sink. “He was a pretty secretive person,” she said.

**Detective Confirms Link Between ‘Secret Beach’ and Crime Scene**

Detective John Guillot of the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office testified Wednesday about a key connection uncovered through Anderson’s former girlfriend. Guillot told the jury that after interviewing the woman who testified earlier that day, she led investigators to a secluded stretch of shoreline she and Anderson had visited multiple times during their relationship.

Referred to by Anderson as his “secret beach,” the location turned out to be Warnimont Park—the same area where Sade Robinson’s dismembered leg was discovered in April 2024.

**Texts with Robinson, photos recovered from Anderson’s phone**

Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office Detective Mason Kohlhapp testified about a phone extraction through which he recovered a text conversation between Maxwell Anderson and Sade Robinson, two days before they went on their date the night of Robinson’s disappearance.

Throughout March 30, 31, and April 1, Robinson and Anderson planned their date over text messages, which Kohlhapp read from the stand. The two coordinated to meet at the Twisted Fisherman, which they did around 5:18 p.m. on April 1.

After meeting Robinson that evening, Anderson’s following text to Robinson, recorded in the phone extraction, was at 10:36 a.m. on April 2, the following day, when he asked Robinson about her work. That text, timestamped after Robinson’s car was torched, was the last he sent to her, Kohlhapp stated.

Kohlhapp also spoke about photographs recovered in the phone extraction from late in the night of April 1. The photos appear to show Robinson on a red couch, partially undressed. The detective said he could not determine from the images whether Robinson was alive or conscious when they were taken. 

**Judge Allows Limited Testimony After Dispute Over Abuse Allegations**

Tensions flared in the courtroom Wednesday as attorneys for both sides clashed over the scope of testimony allowed regarding Maxwell Anderson’s past behavior in a previous relationship. During testimony from Anderson’s ex-girlfriend, Judge Laura Crivello briefly excused the jury while lawyers debated whether evidence of emotional abuse could be introduced.

The dispute arose after defense attorney Anthony Cotton asked the witness whether Anderson had ever been physically abusive. She answered no. Prosecutors quickly objected, requesting a sidebar and later arguing that the question mischaracterized Anderson’s behavior and violated a prior agreement between both parties to avoid character evidence.

Assistant District Attorney Megan Newport argued that the defense’s question opened the door to further context. She cited three examples that suggested abuse in other forms: the ex-girlfriend’s prior statements to police that Anderson was emotionally abusive, an alleged 2022 bar fight with her ex-boyfriend, and a disturbing instance in which Anderson allegedly told her to “beat herself up” and then claim her ex-boyfriend caused her injuries.

“This was not something the state intended on eliciting,” Newport said, noting the state had stuck to the agreed-upon limits until the defense breached them. Cotton countered that distinguishing physical abuse from emotional abuse was key to his line of questioning and did not imply Anderson had a peaceful character overall.

Judge Crivello sided partially with the prosecution, ruling that the state could question the witness about the bar fight and the “beat herself up” comment—but not about claims of emotional abuse. When the jury returned, the prosecution narrowed its focus and asked only about the 2022 altercation at the bar.

**Forensic Expert: Deleted Photos and 
Netflix Activity Followed Date Night**

Digital forensic expert Jason Ruff of the Wisconsin Department of Justice testified Thursday that Maxwell Anderson’s phone data revealed multiple deleted images of Sade Robinson, some of which were referenced earlier in the trial.

According to Ruff, Anderson’s phone showed camera activity between 10:07 and 10:57 p.m. on April 1—the night of his date with Robinson. Just over an hour later, at 12:05 a.m., deletion activity began. Ruff told the jury that 32 images were modified, and by 12:08 a.m., there was no further human interaction with the phone. It later powered down due to a drained battery at 1:35 a.m., and turned back on around 9:20 a.m.

Ruff also revealed that Robinson’s Instagram page appeared to be viewed on Anderson’s phone on April 2 and 3, raising additional questions about his behavior in the days after her disappearance.

On Anderson’s computer, forensic data showed that Netflix was accessed starting at 12:07 a.m. on April 2. At least three episodes of Love, Death, and Robots played, followed by another science fiction series. No computer activity was logged after 12:28 a.m.

Prosecutors concluded their direct examination of Ruff shortly before lunch. The defense is expected to cross-examine him when court resumes at 1:30 p.m.

**Defense Highlights Lack of Suspicious Internet Searches on Anderson’s Devices**

As the defense began its case Wednesday afternoon, they resumed cross-examination of Jason Ruff, the digital forensic investigator who analyzed Maxwell Anderson’s electronics following Sade Robinson’s disappearance.

Ruff, a senior investigator with the Wisconsin Department of Justice’s Division of Criminal Investigation, confirmed that while Anderson’s phone and computer contained deleted images and app activity, there were no search queries for phrases such as “how to dispose of a body,” “how to remove DNA,” or “how to clean up a crime scene.”

This line of questioning appeared to support the defense’s effort to undercut any suggestion of premeditation or post-crime research on Anderson’s part.

Ruff reiterated that a total of 32 deleted cache photos were recovered from Anderson’s phone. He also restated that the phone powered off at 1:30 a.m. on April 2 due to a dead battery—information consistent with earlier testimony.

**Forensic Anthropologist Has History of Cracking Cold Cases**

Forensic anthropologist Jordan Karsten testified on June 5, bringing not only his expert analysis of Sade Robinson’s remains but also a notable track record of helping solve high-profile cold cases in Wisconsin and beyond.

Karsten, a professor at UW-Oshkosh and consultant for the Wisconsin DOJ’s crime lab, has lent his expertise to multiple long-unsolved investigations. Among them was the identification of skeletal remains belonging to a 7-year-old Michigan boy, helping close a 65-year-old cold case in Mequon. He also contributed to resolving the 1983 disappearance of Starkie Swenson, a Neenah man believed to have been murdered.

Karsten’s work extends internationally as well. According to the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, he played a role in identifying the remains of an American soldier who had been missing since World War II’s Normandy campaign.

**Prosecution Rests After Eight Days; Judge Denies Defense Motions**

At 2:30 p.m. on June 5, prosecutors officially rested their case against Maxwell Anderson, concluding eight days of testimony and over 60 witnesses. With the jury dismissed, the defense immediately challenged elements of the state’s charges.

Defense attorneys argued that two of the charges—hiding a corpse and mutilating a corpse—were “multiplicitous,” meaning they penalize the same conduct. Under Wisconsin law, a judge must determine whether the offenses are legally identical and whether the legislature intended for multiple punishments.

Judge Laura Crivello ruled that, at this stage, the charges are not multiplicitous and will both remain. She also denied the defense’s motion for a directed verdict, which would have dismissed the case if the judge found the prosecution’s evidence legally insufficient.

Crivello said that when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, the case warrants proceeding. 

**Judge Denies Directed Verdict; Defense Rests Without Calling Witnesses**

Judge Laura Crivello denied defense attorney Anthony Cotton’s request for a directed verdict on June 5, allowing the trial against Maxwell Anderson to proceed toward its conclusion. A directed verdict, as defined by the State Bar of Wisconsin, is when a judge instructs the jury to return a specific verdict based on the evidence presented, typically because one side argues there is no legal basis for conviction.

In this case, Crivello found the state’s evidence sufficient to let the jury decide the outcome.

Following the ruling, Cotton confirmed that the defense would not call any witnesses. With both sides having now rested, the trial will move into its final phase. Jurors are expected to hear closing arguments next, after which they will begin deliberations to determine Anderson’s fate.

**Both Sides Rest; Closing Arguments Next in Anderson Trial**

After seven days of testimony, more than 65 witnesses, and over 300 pieces of evidence, the state officially rested its case against Maxwell Anderson. The trial now moves into its final phase.

Outside the presence of the jury, defense attorney Anthony Cotton renewed his request for a directed verdict. Judge Laura Crivello denied the motion, stating that when viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution—as required by law—the evidence could support a guilty verdict by the jury.

Following the ruling, Cotton announced that the defense would not call any witnesses and formally rested its case.

Closing arguments are expected to begin shortly, with each side allotted 45 minutes to present their final statements before the jury begins deliberations.

**Judge Delivers Final Instructions to Jury Before Closing Arguments**

Circuit Court Judge Laura Crivello delivered final instructions to jurors Thursday morning as the homicide trial of Maxwell Anderson enters its final stage. With both the prosecution and defense set to begin their closing arguments—each allotted 45 minutes—Crivello emphasized the jury’s role and outlined the legal standards they must apply.

Among the key instructions:

	•If jurors are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Anderson committed first-degree intentional homicide, they may still consider the lesser charge of first-degree reckless homicide.

	•A unanimous verdict is required in a criminal trial. If the jury cannot reach one, a hung jury may be declared, and the case could be retried.

	•There is no time limit on deliberations. Jurors may take as long as needed—whether hours or weeks—to reach a decision.

“You jurors are the judges of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence,” Crivello stated, underscoring their responsibility.

She also warned them not to be influenced by any perception of her opinion on the case: “If any member of this jury has an impression of my opinion as to whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty, you should disregard that impression entirely.”

The panel—made up of 12 women and three men—was seated on May 27. Three jurors will be dismissed as alternates following instructions, leaving 12 to deliberate Anderson’s fate.

**In closing argument, Vance-Curzan describes Robinson**

Prosecutor Ian Vance-Curzan echoed his opening statement in his final message to jurors: use ""common sense and search for the truth.""

He soon turned to Robinson, the 19-year-old victim in the case. The attorney described her as ""anything and everything"" that someone that age would want to be. She worked two jobs, went to Milwaukee Area Technical College, supported herself and lived in a small studio apartment on the city's east side.

""Most of all, she was respected and loved by her family,"" Vance-Curzan said. ""She was fun, social and clearly anybody who cared about her deeply – until she came into contact with 33-year-old Maxwell Anderson.""

**Prosecutor Declares Anderson a ‘Killer’ in Emotionally Charged Closing Argument**

In a powerful and pointed closing argument, Assistant District Attorney Ian Vance-Curzan directly accused Maxwell Anderson of murdering and dismembering 19-year-old Sade Robinson, calling him a “killer” as he gestured toward the defendant in front of the jury.

Using a digital presentation, Vance-Curzan walked jurors through Robinson’s final days, combining surveillance footage, cell phone mapping, and forensic evidence to construct a narrative of premeditated violence. He alleged that Anderson lured Robinson back to his home, killed her, dismembered her body, and then spent the night driving around the city—disposing of her remains and torching her car.

The prosecutor underscored several key pieces of evidence: the deleted images from Anderson’s phone that appear to show Robinson incapacitated; the DNA of both individuals found on a sweater Anderson wore the next day; and the large backpack he was seen carrying—now missing.

As his argument reached its climax, Vance-Curzan didn’t hold back from the horror of the crime. “What kind of person cuts off someone’s head? A killer,” he said. “A killer who’s trying to get away with killing.”

He then pointed directly at Anderson. “There is no question about the person responsible for doing it. The killer—it’s him.”

As he finished, a brief moment of applause broke out from Robinson’s family seated in the gallery, underscoring the emotional weight of the moment.

**Defense Urges Jury to Set Emotions Aside, Argues Lack of Intent to Kill**

In his closing argument, defense attorney Anthony Cotton acknowledged the emotional weight of the case but urged jurors to remain focused on the evidence rather than the emotion surrounding Sade Robinson’s death.

“This is a highly emotionally charged case,” Cotton said. “But I ask you to check your emotions at the door.”

Cotton challenged the prosecution’s narrative, highlighting what he saw as gaps in the state’s case. He emphasized that Maxwell Anderson’s DNA was not found in Robinson’s burned vehicle, nor was Robinson’s DNA discovered in Anderson’s home—both facts he said cast doubt on the allegations.

“The DNA was powerful for us,” Cotton told the jury.

He also asked jurors to consider each charge against Anderson separately and not to assume guilt across the board.

“I didn’t see any evidence of an intent to kill Sade,” Cotton said, reinforcing the defense’s position that the prosecution failed to prove Anderson acted with the level of intent required for a conviction of first-degree intentional homicide.

**In rebuttal, Vance-Curzan criticizes defense's argument**

In a sharp rebuttal following the defense’s closing argument, Assistant District Attorney Ian Vance-Curzan dismantled the idea that Maxwell Anderson’s calm demeanor in the days after Sade Robinson’s disappearance indicated innocence.

After defense attorney Anthony Cotton pointed to Anderson going to work and not changing his routine as evidence of his innocence, Vance-Curzan countered: “He thought he was going to get away with it. That’s the whole point.”

Vance-Curzan also pushed back against the defense’s emphasis on Anderson’s clean shoes, worn the day Robinson’s torched car was found. Rather than proving anything, he argued, they raised more questions—particularly when considered alongside the now-missing “massive backpack” Anderson was seen wearing.

Turning to the defense’s claim that Anderson may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time, Vance-Curzan challenged the jury to consider one critical detail: “Why on earth is he walking around behind an abandoned building?”

**Jury begans deliberations**

Judge Laura Crivello has instructed jurors of the charges to be considered, and deliberations began at about 4:40 p.m.

The jury will decide on several charges, including first-degree intentional homicide or first-degree reckless homicide; mutilating a corpse; and arson.

Crivello said she would have the jury return to court at about 4:57 p.m. and end its session for the day, unless the jury reaches a verdict.",38,67,2025-06-05 08:39:25,1l3zg4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1l3zg4n/maxwell_anderson_trial_in_milwaukee_day_8_updates/,milwaukee,restaurant_mention

Uncle Wolfie's Breakfast Tavern,Food Recommendations,"Hello good Milwaukeans or at least people familiar with the food scene there. I will be arriving on June 20th to see a concert (Hozier) and I am requesting recommendations for the following:

1.  Best macrobrewery tour (I'm leaning towards Miller's but willing to be convinced otherwise);

2.  Best BBQ establishment;

3.  Best place for a hearty breakfast; 

4.  Best Pizza; and 

5.  Best German food.

Thank you kindly in advanced.

Update:

We ate at Kegel's Inn. It is very good and very similar to German food in Germany. We went to the Miller's Brewery tour. I enjoyed it.

Hey everyone! I’m Journal Sentinel dining critic [Rachel Bernhard](https://www.jsonline.com/staff/12094002002/rachel-bernhard/), and for the first time in five years, we’ve published a list of the year's top restaurants in Milwaukee. 

I took over as the dining critic in 2023 and, with a little over a year under my belt, I took on the daunting task of narrowing down 25 of Milwaukee's best restaurants in 2024. [You can find the list here.](https://www.jsonline.com/story/entertainment/dining/2024/10/23/milwaukee-best-restaurants-2024-critic-rachel-bernhards-top-25/75071982007/)) 

At the end of the year, I also shared a list of some of my favorite new restaurants in the city. [You can see them here](https://www.jsonline.com/story/entertainment/dining/2024/12/26/7-of-milwaukees-best-new-restaurants-of-2024/76450689007/).  

And I’m already in high gear for 2025, with a list of new restaurants I’ve got my eye on, plus a stacked schedule of old favorites I’m happy to revisit soon.  

Wondering about my process? Have your own ideas about what should be on this list or where I should eat next? Ask me anything related to Milwaukee’s food and dining scene!

* Is there a museum we should not miss? (We plan to go to the Art Museum but we are open to switching to something smaller, different, interesting. We are more into modern art but also curious about weird stuff -- from the print museum up in Two Rivers to the National Mustard Museum in Middleton).
* Is there a coffee shop that is absolutely a must - in addition to good coffee we are looking for ambiance/preservation vibes: converted church, rehabbed firehouse, restored train station, etc are some of the coffee shops that we loved visiting in our trips.
* A neighborhood with some architectural interest? Or with some serious cultural diversity?
* A microbrewery. Anything with a citrus hazy IPA would be nice.
* An independent bookstore (if there is any left).
* Something/anything that you feel compelled to recommend for reasons that we may never comprehend but maybe appreciate when we get there?

We pay $323.2 million dollars for the Milwaukee Police Department, per year at this point in 2025. That's more than the next highest department ""Public Works'. Ya know, the 24/7 operation of processing clean water, sewage, trash, and transportation infrastructure. What do our citizens interact with more? Water, sewage, trash, and transportation, or law enforcement? My point is there is a reasonable utility to an expenditure on a department as vast as ""Public Works"", but the Police Department is so inherently more narrow and focused of a use.

I just want to really drive home that we are paying the MPD \~40% of our annual budget. That's four of every ten dollars we allocate for ""government"" programs go to our police. For what? Honestly.

\*N Van Buren St. needed squad cars on every block like 2 hours ago. This is a shit show, someone is going to get hurt. We genuinely need some traffic cops right now and some officers to calm down folks blasting music at literally 124 dB (I fucking measured it because I'm an audiophile nerd and I have the means). FWIW I've clocked over a dozen cars at this point over 100 dB. This is stupid. How are they not enforcing our most basic laws and ordinances, or generally being more helpful with $323.2 million fucking dollars? I'm really sick and tired of our MPD being apparently above the call of duty for the seemingly basics of the job; traffic police.

They are a major safety hazard not being visible in inclement weather that I’ve seen near head on crashes & with a touch of a Russian dash-cam car crash video (none on major streets) 

Who is the city department that paints these lines on streets? orrrrr is a “cheapest bid” subcontractor that’s friends with the mayor? This needs to be addressed for safer streets.",125,50,2025-02-10 19:59:58,1imnfh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1imnfh8/the_road_lines_are_in_abysmal_condition/,milwaukee,restaurant_mention

Stella Van Buren,Does Metro Car Wash have a deal with the city/parking enforcement?,"At 4:45pm today, Metro Car Wash on Van Buren had orange cones blocking PUBLIC parking spots to hold them for their customers. They also have cars parked in no parking spots all day. The owner's G-Wagen license plate (which is pretty much always in the No Parking spot) has the company logo on it covering a good portion of the plate, which is definitely illegal. They also often have cars parked blocking the protected bike path (and sometimes even double parked into car traffic), and employees at least once have threatened a cyclist for complaining about the right of way being blocked.

I know I am not the only one, because [here is a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1e1xjo8/metro_car_wash_people_threaten_biker_for/) from a year ago about the cyclist incident, and people in the comments backing up what I said about illegal parking, etc. I would also be able to go get photo evidence if needed. 

I have reported on the city's mobile action app with the parking report form, but nothing has been done. Is next step the alderman?

Stella Van Buren,Seeking Alternative Hair Stylist,"Hello Milwaukee! 

I live about an hour away from both big cities (Madison, Milwaukee) and am in desperate need of a stylist as I’ve just moved to this state and area.

I currently have a grown out ?mullet?shullet? situation that I want help transitioning into something else — I’ve inspo pics, as well as detailed complaints about what I don’t love with my current hair. 

I have reasonable expectations! I know I can’t have the exact style I want now at the length I want, but I do need to go ahead and foster a connection with a stylist and talk about my goals and desires for my hair. 

I love vivids! I’m an avid split-dye, rainbow, all over color palette kind of gal, and I really want a hairstylist who is comfortable with alternative looks & fashion. I also don’t want to support hateful groups or organizations, so a stylist that aligns with my own moral compass is super important.

Stella Van Buren,414 Kia owners with less targeted or 'new logo' (KИ) models... what's been your recent experience?,"Sorry to pull out the dead horse beating stick with this one, but...

I was biking around the Lower East Side a few days ago, around Ogden & Van Buren, and noticed more than a few newer Kias that were SUVs/minivan models (Sportage, Sorento, Telluride, maybe?), all with the new ""K*И*"" logo just parked out on the street, no visual theft deterrents that I could see.

I know theft rates have been trending down, and those cars were likely push-button starts which aren't vulnerable to the same exploit as the turnkey cars. However, the talk over recent posts [(1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1ksxav2/moving_into_milwaukee_safe_to_get_a_kia/) [(2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1kb2ef5/kia_carnival_in_mke/) seems to be a mix of 90% ""even if they can't steal it, them Boyz'll break the window, try, and cause some damage regardless"" and 10% ""don't worry, no one wants to steal a mom-mobile.""

So, I thought I'd ask: **if you own a newer Kia (2023+) with the new badges & push-to-start and/or one of the minivan / SUV models, what's your experience been like with the car in the city?**

Is it really not that bad if you don't have an oval-badge Kia or a sedan, or was I seeing a bunch of fools just waiting to get got?",4,10,2025-06-06 22:29:26,1l5bavs,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1l5bavs/414_kia_owners_with_less_targeted_or_new_logo_kи/,milwaukee,restaurant_mention

Sanford,"Milwaukee, where do you actually eat?","

Hi,  
We’re four guys who mapped out Milwaukee’s dining scene in an app called Vota. The idea is straightforward: you see two places side by side (Sanford vs AJ Bombers), pick the one you prefer, and the ranking updates instantly. The more people vote, the sharper and more accurate the list becomes. There are still a few duplicates here and there, but we’re cleaning the data nonstop.

I know this can look like self-promotion, and I get that city subreddits get tired of repeat posts, but a bunch of you have already rated places around Milwaukee and the feedback has been surprisingly positive. The usual complaints were “no Android” (fixed now) and “no website” (coming soon). If this annoys you, feel free to ignore me and I won’t post again. No sponsorships, no restaurant deals, nothing commercial. Just locals shaping the ranking.

Here’s the iPhone version, with categories matched to what people actually eat in Milwaukee:

And here’s the Android version (finally live):  
[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.vota.app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.vota.app)

P.S.: I’m not from Milwaukee (I live in Gothenburg). I don’t collect data, don’t sell anything, and the app doesn’t use AI-generated content. I’m posting in a few subreddits because we now support multiple regions, and I’m hoping for real feedback from people who actually know the area.",25,16,2025-11-30 07:10:05,1pahx9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1pahx9l/milwaukee_where_do_you_actually_eat/,milwaukee,restaurant_mention

The Fitz,New upper east side apartment reaches 100% capacity,"""If you build it, they will come."" The Fitz apartment complex just reached 100% occupancy, per their IG in less than 11 months. I'm not affiliated just saw it shared on Insta.

Despite pushback against new apartments in Milwaukee, especially on Reddit, this shows that well-located, walkable housing is both needed and in demand.

In my opinion, the Fitz's location is better than the Couture or 333 Water (and obviously smaller in scale), but if walkable amenities can be added to those areas, there's no reason they can't fill up too. The Fitz is also visually appealing and fits the neighborhood well.

I'm hopeful the 7-story project on Stowell near Downer moves forward.

Quin Apartments

Does anyone live in these buildings or has previously and can speak to my question? Or indicate any buildings I should avoid? (Might add a few more to the list). Before anyone comments bugs are inevitable in a city, I can live if I see one or two a year. But anything more than that to me is an insulation and bug treatment problem.

We got the gameday pizza egg roll and a passion fruit/pineapple lemonade, forgot the fair name of it, but that's what was in it. The egg roll just didn't have to many ingredients to it and was probably a little to greasy for my taste.  I would recommend the passion fruit/pineapple lemonade though. They serve it in a nice little bucket that is sealed great and allows you to easily carry it around the fair grounds. Great flavor to it, but I will admit I'm a sucker for anything with passion fruit.

food,I went to the emergency meeting of the Health & Safety Committee today in light of increased gun violence downtown.,"Basically, the consensus was that *some* of police and city resources will be reallocated to cover downtown, but that will mean less resources for even more troubled areas. The barriers the city purchased won't be here for another 50 days. There was quite a bit of bickering back and forth about lack of communication. Alderman Bauman really laid into the police for not having an actual plan. The police pretty much said, ""Sorry. We don't have the budget or the manpower."" There was no time for community members to give testimony, though Alderman Spiker stayed afterwards and talked to people.

Alderwoman Coggs looked like she was tired of the bullshit. She kind of had a mic drop moment where she was like, ""I have another meeting to attend, but we're not going to police our way out of this. Eventually, we're going to have to handle the systemic issues that are leading to this,"" and then walked out. Which, is pretty much how I feel about it.

The police and a couple of the aldermen kept bringing up TikTok and how kids are doing it for views, but I feel that's a cop-out. 59% of children in the state of Wisconsin report being depressed, anxious, and/or suicidal. And federal, state, and county mental health funding were all just slashed. Unwell kids become unwell young adults, who are more likely to be the victims of or perpetrate crimes.

Some ideas were:

-actually enforcing the curfew (and/or giving parents tickets when this happens, as they already have the ability to do)

-expanding the area where food trucks must close early

-police drones

-shut *all* the scooters down, city-wide, at 9pm (*Edit*: It would appear I misheard this point. Don't panic.)

-ID everyone and make them go through a metal detector to get into Water St. entertainment districts on the weekends

-revoke Elmnt's operator license

-invest more in Promise Keepers (They apparently only have three staff members who are allowed 20 operating hours per week. Idk if that's individually or total between them all.) (When Baumann asked the community wellness officer if it would be feasible to increase presence for the rest of the summer. She replied, ""We can try, but it will be very difficult.)

-security coordinated between all bars in the district to reduce the risk of people getting kicked out, but then, let in to a different club


It was kind of fucking bleak, ngl. Thoughts?

Beerline Cafe is the place most accommodating but we were hoping for other recs or if anyone knows a spot that offers non-soy based tofu substitutes? I can't tell from most online menus (e.g. wonderland).

dinner,Sunday/Monday Dinner,"A friend and I jumped into Sinabro around 8:15pm last night (Sunday). We knew it was pushing it and thanked them for accepting us - after DanDan turned us away ten minutes prior for ""technical difficulties"" and Char'd was just closed entirely, although listed as open.
Our server said we needed to have food in before 8:30pm. We ordered on the fly, and everything came out fast - and was actually far better than I anticipated.

The girls working front of house were kind and seemed a bit nervous, or maybe more green. At 9:10pm, the host came to us to say, ""Just so you know, we are closed."" We wrapped up our food as they collected plates and glassware rather frantically.

Not to play the ""I'm a server card,"" but I am currently a bartender - and have had countless FOH W2s to file over the last decade. Sometimes my coworkers roll their eyes at me because I genuinely operate with the mentality that my guests can finish while I do a lot of back end things at close. If I'm operating within my restaurant or bar's permitted hours,  I am happy to serve another round of drinks to a couple or two while I do the cleaning and restocking I have to do anyhow. Sometimes it earns another $20+ on the closing hour I am there anyways. As long as I'm not keeping another server or the dishwasher on just for my gain, I'm happy to close alone and leave a better atmosphere.
This was the first time that I've really felt chased out of a restaurant.

I know things are different post-2020. I feel like Milwaukee has quite a few restaurants now that are staffed by young people that have a completely different approach to hospitality and service than ten years ago. I suppose I don't know what each of them are paid, and can respect if they are being self-advocates. Same time, I know a lot of restaurants are paying front of house much more per hour than when I started. And I think some places just easily develop the mob mentality hatred for customers in the last hour - and it has made Milwaukee a VERY hard city to dine in after 8pm.

Curious if others are having similar experiences or, preferably, where they are having better experiences?

Looking for somebody with some experience on flying out of MKE.  

I haven't been on a plane in some years, but have a wedding to attend in florida and will be flying down.  

Spirit airlines has some rather stringent regulations on luggage, so I don't have much space, so I'm thinking I'll just wear on the plane what I'll wear to the rehersal dinner, bingo bango.  

Now that's just a jacket, vest, shirt, tie, pants.  This also helps me have an outer layer for the wisconsin cold without lugging my winter coat all the way down to sunny florida.  

Besides, I am about to be strapping my ass to an aluminum tube and hurdling through the air at 500 miles an hour in a feat inconcievable to almost every person who ever lived.  Might as well dress nice.  

So in the end I'm no more layered than your average business traveler in a suit.

dinner,Community Resources & Ideas to Help People Losing SNAP Benefits,"I think as a community we should try and help our neighbors who may be losing SNAP benefits. I am also trying to brainstorm ideas that I can do to help. I know others have shared local food banks, but they're already are overwhelmed and will only get busier and potentially run out of food. Obviously if you can donate money or food to a shelter that is the one of the best things you can do right now. I recently became a volunteer at Hunger Task Force myself.

Below is a list of my ideas. Critique them if you please, but I am not here to judge those that need help. 

1. I think the timing up of this with Halloween means that if you are handing out Halloween candy, you should consider leaving out a donation bin of non perishable food/canned food and fruits & vegetables. This is a much more direct way of sending food to those that need it. I am an apartment dweller so this doesn't work for me. I can imagine some of the kids getting the candy might only have that to eat for the foreseeable future. We recently had several PNS grocery stores close done so there areas of MKE with food deserts. If kids are coming to your neighborhood for candy especially if you live in an area with limited grocery store options please consider this. 

2. I regularly eat at Sam's club cafeteria and they sell a $1.50 hotdog combo/$2 pizza meals similar to Costco. Aldi is also doing a $40 thanksgiving dinner. Most of them items are spices/canned food. Although I think it would be better just to donate $40 to a local food bank, this is also a potential option.

3. I know restaurant owners already have tight margins, but they should consider if people have SNAP to give them a discounted/free meal. McDonald's is doing their Monopoly game and a lot of the prizes have been free food. Although fast food isn't healthy nor cheap nowadays. Putting pressure on larger chains/franchises to do this is also something that can be done. It is good PR for them. 

If anyone has any other ideas in the comments please let me know. You can use this post as a way to share ideas and maybe help each other. If you are someone on SNAP and need assistance feel free to link up with people in the comments. My dm's are also open.",35,10,2025-10-28 10:55:18,1oid61e,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1oid61e/community_resources_ideas_to_help_people_losing/,milwaukee,general_food

I will be relocating to the Milwaukee area with my husband and kiddo and we are looking at the north burbs based on schools and proximity to downtown. Apologies for the very ignorant question, but I have spent most of my life in cities (currently in Chicago) and so suburban living is new to me. How big of a lifestyle difference is Fox Point vs Whitefish Bay? I imagine we will be car dependent either way. What about city conveniences - Can I take an Uber to Milwaukee for dinner and drinks? Can I get food delivered? Any input is greatly appreciated! 

Edit: I am middle aged and lame. Looking for a home where it is possible to enjoy city-ish conveniences while still having enough space where I don’t hear my next door neighbor cough.

dinner,So you've wanted to try curling?  Here's your chance.....,"So you've been mesmerized by watching curling on TV - the way the stones glide down the ice and then click and bump each other out. The strategy involved is pretty much chess on ice, with the added requirement to have the skill to send a 42 pound stone down the ice at a precise angle with the proper force for the shot called. And what is all that sweeping and yelling about?

The Racine Curling Club is holding Learn to Curl sessions Friday and Saturday, October 24th & 25th. You won't be ready for the Olympics afterwards, but we will teach you the basics. For those who face physical challenges who don't think they can squat down and throw out of the hack, we'll teach you an alternative delivery method using a ""stick"" that can be done standing up. It's also good exercise - you can really slay some calories by sweeping.

Our club members have competed in Canada, Scotland, Iceland, throughout Wisconsin and the US, and even over the Cheddar Curtain in Illinois against FIBS (whom we do welcome at our club, we have several who cross the border to play with us). We have some top level curlers in Racine, but we're friendly and don't bite - we were all beginners at one point. Curling is also a very social sport - after each match, we sit around the table with munchies and beverages and solve some of the world's problems. One of our ""social"" leagues features a potluck dinner. Curlers are some of the friendliest people around.

Come on out and give it a try - [click here to sign up - slots are limited.](https://racinecurlingclub.com/try-curling/learn-to-curl/) You'll get to see our ice house that was renovated in the summer of 2024 with a new and improved ice sheet.",36,9,2025-10-23 11:53:48,1oe8kya,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1oe8kya/so_youve_wanted_to_try_curling_heres_your_chance/,milwaukee,general_food

lunch,Milwaukee Co Jury duty craziness,"Are any recent jurors struggling to process their time served? I’m having a hard time adjusting after a week servicing on a homicide case. It’s all so surreal… it almost felt like an episode of Squid Game when you show up and are anxiously waiting for your name to be called only to be assigned a number and be herded like cattle to the court room.

Everyone always jokes about “ways to get outta it” but the judge was making you eat out of their hands to cut down on people making BS excuses. For example they asked if anyone dislikes guns and multiple people raised their hands, followed up by questions like “do you dislike guns SO much that you wouldn’t be able to put your feelings and beliefs aside to act as a non biased juror in this case?”. It’s very clear that getting people to commit is becoming a larger and larger issue.

The case was really uncomfortable with obvious images of gun violence and gut wrenching testimonies and big attitudes between prosecutors. But what I found more disturbing was how Milwaukee Co let’s family members mingle around the juror room on lunch break and even outside of the courthouse after you’re dismissed. It doesn’t feel like there was much regard for safety or an attempt to keep us out of the way. 

My biggest issue was when the defense and state dismissed us and we started our deliberations only to find that they gave us ONE (1) copy of the juror instructions which included the laws we were to follow. I did a bit of research and this is becoming more uncommon. Think about it: 12 people, ONE packet containing all of the guidelines for how to go about deciding on a verdict. It was insanely irresponsible in my opinion and as the person that ended up reading the packer we could have done so many things wrong if I didn’t take the time to read through it all. Example: We took an initial vote to figure out where we stood and didn’t even differentiate between guilty for 1st degree (life) or 2nd degree (25 years). People couldn’t follow simple directions like only taking 5 mins to speak your turn and even started throwing personal attacks.

It was clear everyone wanted to leave on Thursday and didn’t want to put in the time to stay another day (Friday) to further debate if self defense was justified. It was a gross feeling that I can’t kick.

**Day 5 Wraps with Bar Footage of Robinson and Anderson**

Prosecutors reviewed a surveillance video from Duke’s on Water, which showed Robinson and Anderson on the night of April 1. The two arrived around 6:30 p.m. and were seen drinking, socializing, and playing beer pong with another couple. Anderson appeared to consume more alcohol and was seen playing dice with a nearby patron. At 8:30 p.m., he stepped outside for a cigarette. By 9:03 p.m., they left the bar together, with Anderson briefly putting his arm around Robinson before they returned to her car. Detective Jake Puschnig testified Robinson did not appear impaired in the footage. Side-by-side photos shown in court linked Anderson’s mugshot with footage from the bar and a Milwaukee County Transit System bus on April 2.

**Bar Owner and Lead Detective Testify**

The sixth day of trial opened with testimony from a managing partner of Duke's on Water, who said he recognized Anderson from previous visits and recalled seeing him at the bar with a date on April 1—the day he and his partner officially took ownership.

Milwaukee County Sheriff's Detective Joann Donner then returned to the stand. She was the first officer called to Warnimont Park after Sade Robinson's leg was found on April 2. Donner testified that Robinson's Life360 data led investigators to Anderson's South Side home, confirming he was the last person with her.

**Detective Testifies on Blood Speckled Gloves Found Near Crime Scene**

Detective Hoe Love from the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office testified about three latex gloves discovered near the shore at Warnimont Park on April 9. Photos showed the gloves were speckled with blood but not soaked. They were found south of a water pump, while Sade Robinson's leg had been located further up the bluff.

Love also described a recent on-site experiment he conducted during the trial, in which he and a colleague tried throwing latex gloves off the bluff to see if they could reach the beach. He said the gloves didn't come close, despite it being in a windy day. On cross examination, Love admitted he did not document the experiment with a report or video.

**Detective Details Blood Speckled Gloves Found Near Shoreline**

Detective Hobe Love testified about three latex gloves found Near Warnimont Park's beach on April 9. The gloves—two together and one separate—were speckled with blood and located just south of a water pump. Sade Robinson's leg had been discovered nearby, further up on the bluff.

Love also described a recent experiment he conducted with a colleague during the trial. They attempted to throw latex gloves off the bluff to see if they could land on the beach. Despite windy conditions, none of the gloves reached the shore. Under cross-examination, Love admitted he didn't document the test with a report or video.

**Detective Testifies About Items Recovered from Anderson's Home**

Detective Kayla Bjerke of the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office testified about the search of Maxwell Anderon's home following his arrest. Investigators recovered 51 knives from the kitchen, a knife sharpener, a fireman, bedsheets, an axe mounted on the living room wall, and several journals and miscellaneous writings. Additional knives were found throughout the home, though Bjerke couldn't recall exact details.

The search also aimed to locate the clothing Anderson was seen wearing in surveillance footage from MCTS buses—specifically a dark hoodie, pants, and a camouflage backpack seen shortly after Robinson's car was set on fire. Those items were never found.

**Gray Hoodie with Matches and Knife Found Near Anderson's Home**

Milwaukee Police Detective Vincent Lopez testified about searching garbage bins near Maxwell Anderson's home on April 9, 2024. Although the trash had already been picked up that day. Lopez initially dismissed a gray article of clothing at the bottom of one bin. After later reviewing bus surveillance photos showing Anderson in a gray hoodie, Lopez returned to the same bin on April 12 and recovered the sweatshirt, which matched the one seen in the footage.

The hoodie, wet when found, was shown in court, prompting audible gasps from the gallery. Inside its pockets Lopez found boxes of matches, a lighter, and a Swiss Army knife. The large backpack Anderson was also carrying has never been recovered.

**No Blood Evidence Found in Initial Tests at Anderson's Home**

After the lunch break, defense attorney Jason Findling questioned Detective Kayla Bjerke about the April 5 search of Maxwell Anderson's home. Bjerke testified that investigators conducted presumptive tests—preliminary screenings used to detect possible blood—on various stains found in the residence. None of the tests indicated the presence of Sade Robinson's blood.

**Sweatshirt and Pocket Items Yielded No Direct Link to Anderson**

Under cross-examination by defense attorney Anthony Cotton, Detective Vincent Lopez confirmed there was no video showing Maxwell Anderson disposing of the gray sweatshirt. It was recovered from a neighbor's trash bin, not Anderson's. The matches, Swiss Army knife, and other items found in the sweatshirt pockets were tested for fingerprints and compared to those found in Sade Robinson's burned car, but no usable prints were recovered from the pocket items.

**Surveillance Videos Outline Timeline of Anderson's Movements**

Detective Rachel Smith testified about collecting surveillance footage from neighbor's Ring cameras and other sources near Anderson's South 39th Street home. One video showed Sade Robinson's Honda Civic arriving around 9:30 pm. on April 1, with visible movement in the home's upper unit afterward.

Additional clips captured motion in the yard and at an entry gate between 10:00 pm. and 12:09 a.m. The car was seen leaving the property at 12:47 a.m. On the morning of April 2, at 8:42 a.m., a person wearing a dark hoodie and pants appeared on video—clothing similar to what Anderson wore in Milwaukee County Transit System footage. That bus video showed him stepped off a Route 35 bus near his home at 8:35 a.m.

The jury was shown the clips out of chronological order.

**Court Adjourns for the Day: Jurors Told to Return June 4**

Judge Lauren Crivello ended proceedings at 4:41 p.m. as the prosecution neared the end of presenting video evidence from outside Anderson's home. At least one video remains for Detective Rachel Smith to review in court. Jurors were instructed to return at 8:45 a.m. on June 4 and reminded not to dicuss the case or seek out information, esepcially at this late stage in the trial.",42,118,2025-06-03 08:53:54,1l2ci65,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1l2ci65/maxwell_anderson_trial_in_milwaukee_day_6_updates/,milwaukee,general_food

-think it makes sense when one person gets a pat on the back for doing the exact same thing that someone else got written up for last week...

lunch,Has anyone used the new self Kiosks for emissions test.,"Basically, I need to renew my registration but need an emissions test first. The last few times I have gotten one at a mechanic it has been a long and stressful process (i.e. saying they provide emissions testing, showing up, and being turned away). 

There are self-serve emissions kiosks in Oak Creek and Brown Deer. I am thinking of using one. 

Anyone used one of these yet? Was the wait long? Can I do it over my lunch break? If so, I'll go and tell you all how it went.

Edit/Update: I went to the Oak Creek self service kiosk and there was a line of about 3 people in front of me. Whole thing maybe took about 20 minutes. Very easy. Will definitely be doing this in the future instead of guess/checking mechanics who will preform one. Have usually an hour for lunch and made it back easily in about 40 mins.

It is meant to inform and provide space for thoughtful, respectful discussion about the case. Please keep comments civil and sensitive to the nature of the topic and those impacted.

**Content Warning:** This post contains descriptions of violence and graphic forensic details from an ongoing murder trial. Reader discretion is advised. The defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty in a court of law.

*Last Updated: 17:10 p.m. CST — May, 30, 2025. This post will continue to be updated throughout the day as new information becomes available.*

**Day 4 Begins: Surveillance Footage Shows Figure Leaving Scene of Car Fire**

Testimony resumed Friday morning with Milwaukee Police Detective Casey Donahue returning to the stand. The prosecution opened with surveillance footage from the time of the car fire that destroyed Sade Robinson's 2020 Honda Civic.

The video shows bystanders reacting to the fire, and shortly after, a person wearing dark pants, a hooded sweatshirt, and a tan backpack is seen walking away from the area. According to Donahue, audio from the video captures witnesses saying ""He did that. Call the fire department. Call the ambulance.""

The prosecution also showed earlier footage of a dark blue Honda Civic traveling down West Walnut Street about an hour before the person in dark clothing is seen. The location is adjacent to 31st and Galena, the area where some of Robinson's remains were later discovered.

**Human Remains Discovered Near Playground at 31st and Galena**

Milwaukee Police Detective Jose Flores testified Friday morning about the discovery of human remains near a wooded area adjacent to 31st and Galena streets. Flores said he was called to assist in the investigation on April 5 and 6, 2024.

He and other detectives conducted a ground search of the area, where they recovered what appeared to be flesh attached to a bone along a set of nearby train tracks. Flores testified that the remains were significant enough to immediately alert the medical examiner's office, which later confirmed the discovery was a human bone.

The location is near the area where surveillance footage previously showed a dark blue Honda Civic driving and where a figure was seen walking away from the scene of the car fire.

**Sade Robinson's Mother Leaves Courtroom During Graphic Testimony**

During Friday's proceedings Sade Robinson's mother, Sheena Scarbrough, was seen leaving the courtroom while Milwaukee Police Detective Casey Donahue testified about the discovery of additional remains.

As Donahue described the recovery of a foot found near a retaining wall and as graphic images where shown to the jury—Scarbrough, appearing visibility distraught, exited with the support of a victim services official who had her arm around her. She returned to the courtroom about 20 minutes later.

**Personalized Blanket and Additional Remains Found at Galena Park**

Milwaukee Police Sergeant Cassandra Lindert testified Friday that a blanket belonging to Sade Robinson was discovered at Galena Park on April 6, 2024. Lindert said the blanket was brought to her by Robinson's family and friends, who were conducting their own search alongside law enforcement.

The blanket, which featured printed photos of Robinson and a family dog, had not been seen during he initial search of the park on April 5. Lindert identified in court while testifying.

A few feet away from the blanket additional human remains—were recovered. Lindert testified that the remains appeared to be intentionally covered with leaves, sticks, and a log. She also noted observing red spots that looked like blood near the scene.

**More Surveillance Footage Shows Robinson's Damaged Car on April 2** 

Before the lunch break on Day 4, jurors were shown several surveillance videos that prosecutors say captured Sade Robinson's 2020 Honda Civic being driven through Milwaukee after she was believed to be killed. 

Milwaukee police detectives testified that the footage was collected from multiple locations and showed the car at various times early on April 2. In one clip presented by Detective Thaddeus Shimmels, the car was seen heading north on North 27th Street at 4:50 a.m., and again at 5:20 a.m. on North 33rd Street. Detective Michael Brauneite testified that the vehicle was then spotted at 6:50 a.m. traveling down West Lisbon Avenue. 

All of the footage came from the general area where Robinson's burned car was later discovered, as well as near the park where some of her remains were found. Detectives noted that damage to the front of the vehicle was visible in the videos, including a passenger-side mirror hanging loose. 

**Supporters Gather Outside of Courthouse of Sade Robinson** 

A small group of demonstrators gathered outside the Milwaukee County Safety Building on Friday, where Maxwell Anderson's trial is behind held. They waved signs and chanted ""Justice for Sade"" and ""Say her name"" as drivers passed on State Street, with some honking in support.

The group has been present since jury selection began on May 27. Outward expressions of support inside the courtroom are prohibited, and observers are barred from wearing pink—a color that was significant to Robinson and has become symbolic of support for her. 

**Surveillance Footage Shows Individual Boarding Bus After Fire** 

Following the lunch break prosecutors showed new surveillance footage of a person matching the description of the individuals seen walking away from Robinson's burning car. The figure dressed in dark clothing and wearing a tan backpack, appears in multiple video angles along West Walnut Street around 7:30 a.m. on April 2. 

Milwaukee Police Detective Rachel Smith testified that the individual was later captured on surveillance boarding a Milwaukee County Transit System (MCTS) bus at the corner of North 35th Street and West Lisbon Avenue around 8:07 a.m. When asked by defense attorney Anthony Cotton whether the individual displayed any suspicious behavior, Smith responded that they did not. 

**Bus Camera Footage Positively Identifies Anderson** 

Milwaukee Police Detective Ryan Bergemann testified Friday afternoon about bus camera footage showing a man matching Maxwell Anderson's appearance near the scene of Robinson's burning vehicle. 

Footage from route 57 showed a man in a dark hoodie and tan backpack walking across 35th Street with Robinson's burning car visible in the background. A second angle from route 35 showed the man crossing the street and then boarding the bus. 

Interior footage from the bus captures the man—identified by Bergemann as Anderson—facing the driver, briefly speaking, and then sitting midway through the vehicle. When asked by the prosecutor to confirm the identification for the record, Anderson's attorney responded ""I'm not going to comment on that at this time.""

**Robinson's Mother Confronts Anderson as Court Adjourns** 

As court ended for the week on Friday, Sade Robinson's mother Sheena Scarbrough, shouted at Maxwell Anderson from the gallery, directing strong language toward him as Judge Crivello adjourned the session. 

This moment followed the final evidence presented to the jury for the day: clear images of Anderson on the county bus, moments after the fire, near the site where Robinson's car was burned and remains were later found. 

Judge Crivello reminded jurors to avoid news coverage and discussions about the case over the weekend. Court will resume at 8:45 a.m. on Monday, June 2, 2025.



More testimony and video analysis are expected when court resumes Monday morning.

lunch,How can we help?,"As I’m sure most people know, more and more families are going hungry right now. It’s heartbreaking to see, and I want to do something to help, but honestly, I’m not sure how, especially since I’m a broke college student on Medicaid myself.

I grew up on EBT and free lunch, so I know what it’s like. And what a lot of people don’t realize is that it’s not just adults who are struggling. Kids are going hungry. There are babies without formula. Families doing their best but still coming up short.

Are there any extra community volunteering opportunities happening right now? Or fundraisers, food drives, anything where people can get involved, even if they don’t have much to give?

I just want to find ways to support our community in such a tough time. No one should be going hungry. I appreciate any help you all can provide.",38,15,2025-11-06 11:06:01,1oq4je2,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1oq4je2/how_can_we_help/,milwaukee,general_food
lunch,Public Ice Skating in Winter of 2025-26?,"I'm curious to know what places are available for public ice skating (parks, ponds, et al) around Milwaukee.  Whether it's just regular ice skating vs. a place where people play pick-up hockey isn't super important, I just want to get a better idea of where people are putting in ice this winter.

Places I know about:

* [Center](https://www.centerstreetpark.org/ice-rink) [Street Park](https://www.instagram.com/centerstreethosers/?hl=en) (Tosa)
* [Humboldt Park](https://www.humboldtparkmilwaukee.org/park-amenities/ice-skating/) (Bay View)
* Lake Park (East Side)

But as far as I know, Center Street Park is the only one *currently* open.

EDIT: it was definitely pieces of black tape, and not a band or ribbon. i was able to get a good look while i was checking one guy out. if it is for mourning, doesn't it feel a bit disrespectful to use ripped up pieces of duct tape in place of a proper band?",0,17,2025-07-03 21:20:55,1lr7g9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1lr7g9u/mpd_is_putting_tape_over_their_badge_numbers/,milwaukee,general_food

lunch,a stranger started a fake conversation with me at rocket baby…?,"Hi Milwaukee :)
I am F23. I had a funny experience in Tosa I needed to share. I'm curious if this has ever happened to anyone else.
 
I'm sitting at rocket baby bakery by myself reading a book. All of the tables are full except for mine. A man, maybe in his 40s, dressed in like corporate business attire, asks if he can sit at my table since all the other spots are taken. I don't think anything of it and I say of course. I am minding my own business, reading my book. Shortly after he sits down his phone starts ringing, and then he says ""can I ask you for a favor?"" I say ""sure"" and he says ""When I pick up the phone can you act like we are in an interview?"" I respond hesitantly ""uhhhh sure."" He picks up the phone and says something like ""oh i'm sorry i can't right now, I have an appointment."" He sets his phone on the table and then proceeds to talk to me for literally 10 minutes about buying a piece of property? or something? i had no idea what he was talking about the whole time and was just about dying laughing because it was so awkward and uncomfortable. I just wanted to sit and read my book and eat my little sweet treat and this man disrupted my peace talking to me about mortgages and down payments pretending like i'm gonna buy a property or something?? He would occasionally ask me a question to make the conversation feel natural, and I would have no idea how to respond so he would gesture or mouth things for me to say. He even wrote down a question for me to ask on a business card. The whole time his phone is on the table and it's on a phone call. At first I was nervous it was some sort of scam, but he didn't ask for any personal information, and I didn't even give him my name. After 10 minutes he wraps up the conversation and we make some sort of ""deal"" on the ""property"" and he ends the conversation and leaves the cafe, still on the phone call. And he gives me ZERO explanation. And i was left in shock of what just happened.

what does this guy have to hide? has anyone ever had something similar happen? this story is here to amuse you all if anything. 🙃 ",35,26,2025-01-21 08:05:48,1i6jayy,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1i6jayy/a_stranger_started_a_fake_conversation_with_me_at/,milwaukee,general_food
lunch,Resources for those experiencing homelessness in Milwaukee + how you can help responsibly,"Hey Milwaukee—I’ve been looking into the resources available to the unhoused in Milwaukee and realized that I think there are many people like me who want to help and don’t know how. I wanted to share a few key resources available in the city, especially for food, shelter, and longer-term housing support. I know many of us get asked for money or food, and it can be hard to know what to do. Here’s some info that might help both folks in need and those looking to help:

Shelters & Drop-In Centers: 

The Salvation Army Emergency Lodge – 24/7 shelter for adults, may offer motel vouchers if beds are full. (414) 265‑6360 

Cathedral Center – Emergency shelter for women and families. (414) 831‑0394 

Hope House – Shelter + transitional housing support. (414) 645‑2122 

Repairers of the Breach – Day shelter offering meals, showers, and services (open Mon–Sat). 1335 W Vliet St


24-Hour or Nightly Food Access: 

Street Angels MKE – Mobile outreach offering hot meals, lunches, clothes, hygiene kits several nights/week. (414) 930‑0028 streetangelsmke.org 

Milwaukee Rescue Mission – Serves 3 meals/day, every day, no cost. 830 N 19th St (414) 344‑2211 

Call 2-1-1 (United Way Impact) – Available 24/7 to locate nearby meal programs, pantries, shelters.


How to Get Housing Help: Coordinated Entry

Anyone unhoused should ask to be assessed for Coordinated Entry, the system that connects people to housing programs like Rapid Rehousing or Permanent Supportive Housing. You can get assessed through most shelters or outreach teams like Street Angels or the Benedict Center.

If Someone Asks You for Money…

Instead of cash, you can: 
* Offer info about the services above •	Ask if they’ve heard of Street Angels or Coordinated Entry. 
* If you feel safe, offer food, water, or a transit pass.
* Don’t assume everyone is trying to scam you—many are in survival mode and Milwaukee’s system is deeply under-resourced.
* If you have the ability to donate to these community outreach programs PLEASE do! It is the best way to build our community and support the people who need it most!

Homelessness is complex, but no one deserves to be stuck in it.

One of our favorite parts is finding new, little gems in restaurants we’ve never been to or (even better) frequented many times. What are your recommended must tries as you make your way through this year’s menus?

I’ll go first: the chocolate ganache brownie cheesecake from Blue Bat’s [Downtown Dining 2025](https://www.milwaukeedowntown.com/bid-events/downtown-dining-week) lunch menu.  We were originally bummed as they were out of the yuzu cheesecake, and I’m truly glad they were.  I’m not a huge dessert person, but the entire plate was fun, rich, and playful.  The cheesecake was so smooth and topped on a silky brownie base, all coated in a hard outer shell of milk chocolate, and dusted with cocoa powder.

lunch,Meal prep PICKUP (or delivery to central pickup locations) options,"I'm looking for meal prep options that offer pickup locations. I used to receive Factor, which was great, but I lived in an apartment building that had a refrigerated holding area to receive and hold such deliveries. In my current place in South Milwaukee, there would be no convenient way to receive refrigerated deliveries there.  I would prefer options with convenient pickup locations in downtown, South Milwaukee, or somewhere not too out of the way of my normal commute between downtown and South Milwaukee. 

The best option I've found is Simple Eats Mke. The have a convenient pickup location downtown and the weekly menu looks good. My main issue is that they only offer 6 meal options per weekly menu. So if I want to have both dinner and lunch taken care of, I'd have to double up on a lot of meals. 

Mealwaukee is the only other option I've found, but I'm not sure I want to drive out to Pewaukee to pickup.

I wanted to take my mom out for a birthday lunch or dinner this weekend and she really enjoys dosas.  Are there any Indian restaurants in the area that do a good job of preparing dosas?

Looking for a decent, clean restaurant, not a ""hole in the wall"".  Several years ago, an acquaintance had recommended the Indian grocery store near 27th and Edgerton, which has a take-out restaurant in the back, along with several tables.  It was pretty filthy.  Bombay Sweets on 13th St. is pretty good but am looking for a place that is a bit cleaner and nicer.  

Some here have recommended Indian Delight in Oak Creek... wondering if that'll scratch the itch.  I don't know if they serve dosas, but I've heard good things about Indian Garden in Tosa... haven't been there yet.

EDIT - I also heard/read that Bombay Sweets changed ownership not that long ago... wondering if the food is basically still the same, or if it has gotten better/worse.

Which do you think is better? I’ll be completely on my feet and don’t plan on spending much money, perferabley none (for Milwaukee portion). There’s also an option to have no layover, but I thought it’d be nice to get out and see Milwaukee as I haven’t in 6 or 7 years. Also, the train from Milwaukee to Wisconsin Dells is called Borealis, so I thought it’d be a cool nod to my move to Alaska.

Looking for places that are:
• fun for a group
• good music (Latin music a plus) 
• walkable between bars
• not insanely expensive

We’re all mid20s-early30s mixed group, and they’ve never been to MKE before. I’m thinking maybe Brady, Water St, or Walker’s Point but I’d love real locals’ opinions on where the vibe is best for NYE weekend.

Also open to any must-try bars, late-night food, or tips for avoiding crowds/surge pricing.

I’d like to start a Saturday Morning Breakfast Club for anyone struggling with sobriety. Maybe you’re not sure if you’re an alcoholic but know you drink a little too much. Maybe you’re trying to get healthy. Maybe you, like me, have been medicating with alcohol for years and all your past lies and fuck-ups have come home to roost. All of you are welcome. Let’s meet up, talk about alcoholism, talk about how we’re doing, what tricks we’re trying, and what hurdles we’re facing. 

This is explicitly a non-religious affair, but if you’re religious you’re still welcome!

This is an *apolitical* affair; left or right doesn’t matter, we’re here to support each other through sobriety struggles and not judge. If that seems like something you’d be unable to do, please keep your distance. 

This is going to be an absolute safe-space; LGBTQA+, women, any anyone else concerned about safety are welcome to join!

This will be a completely 100% anonymous affair. No real names. You might know someone there personally, but you don’t know them in these meetings. 

Interested? Send me a DM and we can talk more!

drinks,Where are all the people in their 20s-30s?,"I’m wondering where people around post-college through mid-30s usually hang out in Milwaukee. I’d love to make some new friends eventually, but honestly I’d also just be happy to start by being around people my age more often.

I’ll go to camp in Shorewood to play darts or brat house for trivia or a brat or the occasional beer, in the summers I love south shore beer garden, but aside from that I’m not looking for bar or drinking recommendations. 

Are there certain coffee shops, events, markets, parks, gyms, or activities where people in their 20s–30s tend to gather that are more welcoming or at least increase my chances of meeting people and forming connections? 

Thanks in advance! Would love to hear how you spend your weekends or week nights in Milwaukee, especially with seasonal depression coming up - really trying to be proactive this time around lol!

drinks,"Endless and eternal gratitude to u/chompsworth, an employee of the Milwaukee Art Museum Store who saw my post, found one of these 16 year old mugs, connected with me, and overnight shipped it.","I cannot express how grateful I am. 

I made some local (to me now) beans, filled the mug, and there it was in all of its glory, the orange ""REACT."" It's beautiful and I love it. 

If I am to seek deeper meaning in this delightful serendipitous chain of events, it is that just as I learned in my journey of life, it is okay to ask for help. You never know who on your journey might have the right connections or resources to help you. 

If you read my previous post, let me tell you for many years in early adulthood I struggled. The lack of support network or ""adults older than me"" in my life caused me to struggle more than my peers. But also as I aged I learned more than my situation wasn't unique and a lot of kids escape abusive homes and are trying their best as they transition to independence. I'm able to reflect and appreciate those who took extra time from their lives to invest in mine, even if it seemed insignificant to them. 

I want to use this post as an opportunity to highlight my gratitude to Ms. Craig (who bought me and my peers that Art Museum membership at graduation), Ms. Dalle-Valle, and Mr. Luedtke. They were all educators at Reagan during my time there that would let me spend time with them after-school just to listen to me. And unbeknownst to them at the time, delay my return home to the abusive household I was living in. I wasn't allowed autonomy or independence as a minor and my only respite was school or work. These MPS educators were critical in my mental strength making it to adulthood. 

And the same to Richard Leson (an art history professor) and Jane Hampden Daley (a senior lecturer in the journalism department) at UW-Milwaukee. During my time there both entertained me showing up to their office hours just to talk. Maybe they knew or...or perhaps not, but I was struggling mentally to survive in these years and their kindness contributed to my life far beyond what they could possibly realize. I was a medicore student in college. I worked 40 hours a week at an airport hotel, comminuted by MCTS, and took 18 credits most semesters. I was stretched out and couldn't be the best student due to time commitments but they never treated me any less because of it. 

I moved to rural Dane County in late 2021 because my partner had a terminally ill family member. We're staying here for at least a couple more years to assist his relative who became a widow as a result of the other's terminal illness. I know we're where we need to be right now, but I miss Milwaukee terribly. I don't belong in a small rural town. I belong in Milwaukee. I dont have a vehicle so I lack the autonomy to visit whenever I want. Milwaukee is so close yet so far away because of this. 

Whenever I visit though, I have one core priority and it's always the Art Museum. My individual membership is up for renewal this May and I will make sure it is renewed. I encourage all who are financially capable of becoming members to consider doing the same. You only have to go a couple of times throughout the year for it to immediately pay for itself. 

tl;dr u/chompsworth is an incredible person and employee of the Art Museum Store who located and sent me the mug. Support your local Art Museum. 

Attached are photos of it in it's glory of thermal change. The last photo is the very safe place it will live. I will only drink from it on special occasions, not daily use. It lives among my coveted Michael Leson American Rails Hiawatha collection. (Alongside a matching Pyrex set my late mother in law gifted me one Christmas.)

First-ever Reddit post, so forgive me for my ignorance. 

  
I am currently based in NYC as a financial services professional ( Bond trader), but I'm currently discussing with a team about joining an investment fund based in Wisconsin. 

One of the founders lives in Madison, whilst the other one lives in Milwaukee. The 

Wanted to hear people's perspectives on both areas.

  
For greater context to get the most relevant advice, I am a 26-year-old black male who attended university in DC and has lived in NYC since then. Currently single. Pretty active ( former college athlete)

  
My budget for an apartment would be 4k a month. However, if I were to buy a place, my budget would be around 1 million dollars ( Family support for anyone wondering) 



The hours would be around 60 hours a week, and outside of that, I would not mind staying active within Freemasonry ( I know both areas of lodges). Other than that, most of my hobbies are working out, drinking with friends, and reading. 

Main questions are:

Which area is better for a 26-year-old single male?

Which area is better for raising kids? ( Not there yet, but if I stay at the fund for 5 plus years, that will increasingly become something I will think about). 

Diversity is not a priority, but I also don't want to have to drive an unreasonable amount of time just to get my haircut. 

What area is generally a better real estate investment?

  
Which area has a better food scene?

drinks,Are there any at home alcohol detox services in Milwaukee?,"I’m reaching out because I am in desperate need of help, and I’m having trouble finding it. I am in the end stages of alcoholism, and also struggle with severe, treatment resistant mental illness that has precluded me from getting help. I suffer from severe agoraphobia and inability to leave my home and PTSD. I am a domestic violence and stalking victim, and it has exacerbated my symptoms and self medication. 

I have tried reaching out to several different facilities and keep getting told they are unable to take me. Wellbrook rehab referred me to Rogers because I am too medically and psychiatrically unstable. For context, I have not been to a doctor in 8 years due to my agoraphobia and have been steadily drinking between half a handle and a full handle a day for 5 years. Rogers told me my only option is to go to the ER and try to get admitted with them afterwards. I have called the ER closest to me to see if they can be prepared to take me in for intensive detox treatment when I arrive and they told me I will just have to wait and they may not help me. I am also terrified that I will panic and be unable to make it there/or remain in the waiting room, or that I will discharge myself when I am not in a state to make a sound decision. I have a limited support network and am worried I will not be advocated for or taken care of. 

Does anyone have any resources I could look into? Are there any at home detox services that might be able to help me medically stabilize so I can be admitted in for psychiatric treatment afterwards? I am just very afraid of being traumatized or hurt again and I am really hurting. 

Thank you so much.

drinks,Riverwest 24: My experience and some strategy tips,"Now that it’s over it’s time for some thoughts and a few strategy tips. Let’s discuss the coolest bike race around!

So this year I decided to go it solo and did surprisingly well. Though I didn’t podium, I did figure out some good strategy tips if you’re trying to a) do well and b) have fun (the order is important here. First, my experience.

I am an occasional biker, but not serious. I ride about 2 miles to work where possible but don’t do any serious bike rides and don’t regularly go to the gym. I’m in decent enough shape but smoke and drink a lot of beer, so I’m not some super fit guy ready to blast laps. I also rode a fixie with no brakes so I may be a bit of a nut job (if you saw the green and gold/purple “mardi gras bike” you saw me). All that to say: I wasn’t in an obvious contender. I did, however, and up in 9th for the male solos and was in 4th place all night until my bike got stolen outside of falcon bowl at 9:00am (first a car, now a bike…). So I was far enough ahead that stopping the race halfway through I still was in the top 10. While I’m obviously not the most serious contender, I think I can give some strategic advice.

1) Bonuses are the race, the laps are the bonus. If you want to win, you have to hit every single bonus, which we all know, but prioritize your laps/breaks based on the bonuses, and never sacrifice a bonus for the sake of a lap.

2) Take the stairs and call it a break. I did the switch backs once and the Holton bridge twice. The stairs are the way to go as they utilize different muscles and let you take a quick break from being on your seat, so use them. But never sprint them. Even when I walked up them with my bike I got to the top before people I passed at the commerce st. entrance to the bike path on their way out and my way to checkpoint 3. If you want to compete you have to take the stairs.

3) Beers equal carbs. Yes I had beer the whole time, yes I drank a shit ton of water, but beers are valuable and easy calories that help you go. Figure out a way to get calories/carbs if you want to keep going.

4) Never wait in lines. Teams can cheat by having someone waiting in multiple bonus lines while someone blasts laps with the manifest, but solo riders are stuck making game time decisions. Get to every bonus 10 minutes before it opens and count those 10 minutes as off bike rest time. Ask people in the middle of any line how long it takes and skip it for the next bonus/one more lap if it is slow. If you aren’t early, come back in the last 15 minutes of the bonus. Prioritize doing bonuses based on closure and never go backwards down the lap for them, always hit them along the laps rather than doing extra miles out of your way.

5) Get support, even if you’re solo you can’t be alone. The winners were two guys that biked together as solo racers, and they won because they had encouragement. Around sunrise I desperately needed support laps from friends but hadn’t worked out a schedule, so make sure you figure out who’s riding with you when to keep you going.

6) You navigate with your phone so keep a battery pack. This one’s obvious but you need to keep your phone charged.

7) Don’t ride a fixie with no brakes. I did pretty well but I had intentionally handicapped myself by riding the bike I did, so if you want to compete have a better bike than me. And have a comfortable seat.

8) Use a bike lock if there’s not a static crowd. Obviously a ton of people are around and not locking their bikes, but mine got stolen halfway through which meant I had to stop. Locking your bike (even if it’s just wheel to frame) is worth the extra 20 seconds.

9) Know when you’ll stop. My original goal was top 10, but when I spent 30 minutes in 3rd I realized I could possibly podium. If you’re going to go overnight figure out what will cause you to stop, for me it was missing 2 check points.

I’ve pondered our city’s identity and realized that Milwaukee no longer has an official city slogan.

Over the years, we’ve had several, like:

* “Milwaukee: A Bright Spot” – Early 1900s optimism.
* “Milwaukee: Talk It Up!” – Mayor Henry Maier’s 1970s push for positivity.
* “Milwaukee: A Great Place on a Great Lake” – 1984’s nod to our lakeside charm.
* “Milwaukee: Genuine American” – The 1995 attempt that didn’t quite stick.

More recently, Visit Milwaukee has used themes like “Fresh,” “Flavor,” and “Forward” to encapsulate our city’s spirit. While these aren’t official slogans, they aim to highlight our cultural diversity, culinary scene, and progressive momentum.

Given this, I’m curious:

What do you think would make a great slogan for Milwaukee today?

Should we revive an old favorite, tweak an existing one, or craft something new?

I’m from here, born/raised, but left in 2010 until last fall. And due to several unfortunate life circumstances, I’ve found myself back here (that’s not the bad part), but without friends. The ones I know here don’t respond to my texts, and I assume a lot of that is because they are married with families now! No hard feelings there, obviously.

This is probably, definitely, the lowest time in my life and that’s really saying something.

I’d love to be out in public for Halloween at some welcoming thing that didn’t cost an arm or leg to be at. Anyone know of anything like that? I’m just a lil queer dude who was in Chicago for a long time. Not even looking to drink lol just be around humans. Been sleeping on a couch for a year.

drinks,Announcing the 2025 r/Milwaukee Reddit Meetup Day,"Hello [r/Milwaukee](https://www.reddit.com/r/Milwaukee)!

After a long hiatus, the mod team is excited to announce the return of Milwaukee's Official Reddit Meetup this year, in the tradition of the annual *Global Reddit Meetup Day!*

\[fanfare\]

*When: Saturday, July 12th* 

*Where: Humboldt Park, Picnic Area 1* 

*Time: 11AM – nightfall*

[**Wait, what is ""Global Reddit Meetup Day?**](https://redditinc.com/blog/reddit-global-meetup-is-coming-set-your-calendars-for-june-22-2019)**""**

In the before-times, Reddit would organize Global Reddit Meetup Day for redditors around the world to step away from their screens and socialize, in-person(gasp), with their local community. For years, the amazing folx at [r/Milwaukee](https://www.reddit.com/r/Milwaukee) turned out for a relaxed, festive environment (many of which are documented in the subreddit history).

This post is an official announcement for the time and date while we dust off our picnic supplies in the meantime. In previous years, we have hosted games, grilling, group activities, and Milwaukee-themed raffle prizes (unfortunately, our permit does not allow bouncy houses or pony rides, sorry). Everyone is encouraged to bring any light snacks, quirky desserts, drinks, gourmet meals, or other treats to share with your fellow community. Everyone is welcome to stop by at any time and to stay for as long as they'd like.

The mod team is also putting out the call for any brave and creative souls interested in co-hosting and organizing this year's event with us! We are also in dire need of someone willing to provide a grill and show off their grilling expertise. After all, no summertime fun can be complete without a grill-master in an apron. Anyone who is interested in helping out can send a DM our way to help us get this fire cooking🔥

The comments thread is open to ideas and discussion from all fellow Redditors (but organizers will bear the burden of final decisions). Stay tuned for an official reminder of the event in the coming weeks which will include any further details and weather forecasts.

Sincerely, 

\-the mods",122,26,2025-06-23 06:47:54,1liehse,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1liehse/announcing_the_2025_rmilwaukee_reddit_meetup_day/,milwaukee,general_food

drinks,Milwaukee 30+ invite-only speed-dating event October 22nd,"Hi all,

I posted about our first event about a week ago (before it started to get some weird comments so ended up deleting) and posting again because we got some GREAT attendees from Reddit. 

  
We started (what we feel is) a much needed invite-only professionals speed-dating event   Our first event was earlier this week and was so SO fun and 11 out of 16 (69%) attendees got matches!  I think 100%  would agree it was a really fun night with a room full of like-minded people and great conversation. 

We 3 more dates set in 2025 and we're looking for a few more people to attend our next event on Wednesday, October 22nd 6:30 to 8:30pm. 

  
A few things: 

\- the events are strictly 30+ (sorry kids!). Currently the average age for the next event is 37 to give you an idea. 

\- The price is determined by the location fee - this one is $36.52 with fees and includes two drinks! 

\- The events are true speed-dating style: girls stay still and guys rotate every 5 minutes. You'll be given a sheet to mark anyone that you'd be interested in speaking with again and if there's a match you'll be given each others contact information the next day.

  
The idea is to have a safe, low commitment, fun space for like minded professionals to chat and see if there's a spark! 

Join the Date-a-base at [unhingedspeeddatingmke.com](http://unhingedspeeddatingmke.com) and spread the word!

  
Feel free to leave any questions here or through DM. Thank you! 


Updated 10/29: October 22nd event was a BLAST. 27 attendees with 18 matches!

drinks,Desperately seeking a 2008/2009 Milwaukee Art Museum Act/React Coffee Mug,"Hi. 

In 2009 I graduated high school as well as turned 18 that summer. When I graduated high school (MPS-Reagan, third graduating class and we were quite small) we had an amazing art teacher who gifted us all 1 year student memberships to the Milwaukee Art Museum.

A month after graduating high school I turned 18 and was able to leave home and escape childhood abuse. I had no savings and no support network. I worked 40 hours a week for a shit wage and started the EMT course at MATC. I had no recreational funds BUT I had that student membership. 

I went to the Art Museum all the time. Not just for the art, but to sit up on the third floor seating area where you can look over Lake Michigan. The Art Museum became an important part of my mental health. 

During these first months of what became a lifetime connection to the Art Museum and gazing at Lake Michigan being the first form of ""home"" I redefined for myself as I no longer ""belonged"" anywhere, was the Act/React interactive art installation. Its when they first introduced that infinity room you'd go inside of, which ended up staying for a while beyond the exhibition. I loved it. 

Before the exhibition came to an end, I wanted to get something to represent it. I wouldn't know it at the time but it would become a physical symbol of my independence and rebirth from the trauma of childhood. I was poor and knew I shouldn't...but I bought this mug. 

When you pour hot liquid into it, the black block reveals ""react."" I love it's simple black and white design. That it is interactive. Somehow it survived not one but two Milwaukee slumlords that illegally entered properties I was renting (with no failed payments) to throw remaining belongings out because they deemed me having moved out despite actually just moving one day a week over the course of my final month. It survived a spontaneous move to Madison in 2011 and a subsequent ""put everything in storage and go to California"" later that year. 

In 2016ish someone, with no ill intent, accidentally broke it. I was devastated but tried to brush it off as ""shit happens"" because I too have accidentally broken things. In an attempt to hide my pain from myself, I wrapped what remained in bubblewrap and hid it in a drawer. 

In 2021 I moved again which confronted me with it. I spent so much time trying to find a replica online with no luck. I can't even find that the mug existed. 

Recently I got a new smart ass phone that scans shit and brings up traces of stuff online. Excitedly I just thought of this concept for my mug and pieced it together -- and nothing. I still can't find a trace of it. 

I know I can kitsungi it and make it a mug again--but if I do that it won't be liquid safe. Like I couldn't (or shouldn't I suppose) pour hot water in it to see the ""React"" reveal itself. I know that building it back together probably has some deep metaphor of its ability to stay with me through the years and all the bullshit, and it's still here...just like me...but I still would love to have one I could drink from. I want to feel THAT feeling again. 

Maybe someone randomly bought it at goodwill years ago and it sits in your cabinet and isn't sentimental to you they way it would be for me? Maybe you have some secret connection to archive of Milwaukee Art Museum merch and you know someone that can retrieve one from the bowels of somewhere? I am willing to pay an absurd amount of money for one of these. 

tl;dr This mug means a lot. Internet leads nowhere. Yes I can fix but I want a liquid safe one I can drink from. Am willing to pay up for it. ",156,29,2025-03-08 20:41:33,1j6xrtq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j6xrtq,milwaukee,general_food

drinks,Looking to Make New Friends in Milwaukee 😊,"Hi Milwaukee friends!

My name is David. I’m 27 and recently found myself wanting to expand my circle to meet new people here in our awesome city. I'm an introvert and prefer a smaller circle of quality connections. I'll leave some things about me here in hopes that someone resonates with it. A little about me:

* Interests: I love indoor/beach volleyball, hiking, cooking, board/card games, snowboarding, ice skating, and music festivals. I host game night on Fridays with my friends where we get together, order take out, and play something for 3-4 hours. I’m in a group chat called “We Love Catan.” During the summer we'll go paddleboarding in various lakes. I'm an active person and love a physical challenge / moving around in general. I enjoy the process of getting better at something, bond through hobbies and am really open to new experiences. I've played guitar for 7 years but recently there's been some dust gathering. I think playing music with other people is really fun.
* Most of my friends are cat owners, myself included. No discrimination against dogs or other pets, I take pride in befriending everyone's fur babies! Idk if there's any correlation with your personality and pet preference, but take it for what it's worth.
* If you're into personality tests, I'm an ISTP on the Myers Briggs test and score high on S for the DISC assessment. I march to the beat of my own drum and get along best with people who aren't pushy, are flexible, and non judgmental. I like talking about ideas/concepts over people / gossip. If I feel like you're a genuine person and have my best interests at heart, I'll treat you like family. I don't really care about societal norms...I have tattoos and piercings and wear jewelry because I like how it looks on me and the judgmental stares don't bother me.
* On the more vulnerable side, I'm a recovering people pleaser. I've gotten better at saying no and setting boundaries, and can easily pick up on if someone is trying to take advantage of me. If you're pushy I won't like you. I'm a very independent person because deep down I don't trust other people to take care of my emotional needs. Honestly, I'm not great at taking care of other people's emotional needs either. I'm a great listener and like to help how I can, but I'm probably not the best person to go to for emotional support. Come to me when you're feeling solution driven and I'll help you look at something from different perspective. Hit me up to plan for activates / quality time...that's my jam.
* I don't mind if you smoke weed or drink, or do other substances. I have in the past! I have an addictive personality and am now on my sobriety journey. People who don't respect my sobriety are not welcome in my life.

Lastly, just throwing out that I'm a single pringle. I'm not rushing to find a partner and that's not the intent of this post, but if you're a woman and we get to know each other really well then I might develop feelings for you down the road. I'd be open about how I feel if that were the case.

Thanks for reading!! Make it a great rest of the year, and happy holidays.

It’s the tallest bridge over the Milwaukee River in Milwaukee and it connects four separate neighborhoods:  Brady St., Brewers Hill, Riverwest, and Downtown / Water Street. 

Underneath the Holton is the pedestrian Marsupial Bridge which connects to bike paths and the Oak Leaf Trail. Lakefront Brewery, arguably the most famous currently operating brewery in Milwaukee, sits directly below.

With the Holton Bridge wrapping up several years of re-decking and repainting I think now is the time to light it up like an LED Christmas tree.

brewery,Major rat issue near farwell & Windsor,"This was posted in east side neighborhood on Facebook and I think it deserves some attention. The first post was a little over a week ago. 


There is a major rat problem with a brewery that used to be goodcity brewing but looks like it's now owned by, i think enlightened brewing company possibly? Someone had commented that the owner had changed to that company but I can't find the comment now so don't take that portion of this information as fact.

The facts are that there are what look like uncovered spent grain bins located in the parking lot on the 2100 block of farwell between farwell and prospect and windsor pl. The grain bins are very smelly and have a host of creatures feasting on it, especially rats.

 Not just that but someone is attempting to poison the rats, or so it seems, and there are also carcasses of dead rats all over this parking lot in various stages of decomposition.  Very gross and stinky. This mess is located right next to a couple restaurants and a jewelery store so I'm sure they aren't happy about the rat feast either. 

I'll post the combined videos from the post for you all since I can't post photos and video. You'll see a dead mouse in the video and a live rat leaping away out of a pallet. The city has been notified via online submission form for ""rat harborage "" but they haven't addressed the complaint yet likely due to dealing with storm damage issues.",95,46,2025-08-15 08:09:36,1mqxdwt,https://v.redd.it/uewyttx6n6jf1,milwaukee,general_food

Some may have noticed, but the MKEDeals website isn’t the same as it was before. I’ve had a couple of people reach out to me and ask what’s going on with it, so I figured I would post an update for everyone.

A couple of weeks ago someone actually ended up purchasing the domain name from me. They offered me more for it than I would have ever thought anyone would pay for a silly domain name like that, and honestly the extra cash influx was really nice at this time of year so I really couldn’t say no.

So I, sadly, do not own the domain anymore.

With that said, I do still have the website, and will be updating it once a year, or as new updates come in from users, because I use it myself probably more than anyone and I want to keep it alive. Even if it’s not in the capacity that it was.

You can find the website at it’s new URL here: https://mkedeals.dillonshub.com

So really, as long as people keep using it, I’ll keep updating it. And this domain won’t be sold ever since it’s what I use for my personal stuff lol.

Anyway, thank you to everyone for all the support over the years! It was a really cool passion project that got me back into doing this sort of thing and I’m sure I’ll think of something new the community could use while keeping up with this 🙂.",87,15,2025-12-02 21:11:35,1pct3jz,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1pct3jz/mkedeals_update/,milwaukee,general_food

I’m buying my first ever used car (likely a Honda/Toyota in the $15k/$20k range) and I’m trying to figure out which local credit unions would be the best to finance through.

Here’s my situation:

* First-time car buyer
* Don’t have a ton of extra money, so I need a good interest rate
* Looking at a safe, reliable used car (2018–2020 range)
* Low rent, so I can afford a payment, but I don’t want to get ripped off.....

PLEASE if anyone can tell me Milwaukee-area credit unions are most friendly to new buyers? I’ve heard some people get way better rates than the dealerships offer. Any tips or recommendations would be hugely appreciated 🙏

So, we have liked Good City Brewing for a long time (I know it gets mixed reviews in here but for us at the Farwell location it’s always been consistent and enjoyable). We knew it had been bought out but didn’t realize the extent of the changes, like it was an entirely new restaurant.

Today, we accidentally stumbled on the new restaurant, called Wayfinder. It was opening night, the concept that the manager explained to us was small global plates. They had a deal for 2 drinks and 2 plates for $25. Things like plantains, pork belly, “Asian” wings. Definitely remodeled to look more upscale inside too. We ended up leaving since we really just wanted curds and brewery food and the dishes were small. 

Anyway, it’s a very interesting rebranding. Don’t know how successful it will be, they still have the GCB sign outside which threw us off. Wishing them luck! 

Now that that spot is gone, any good burger and curd recs? We are in the Shorewood area and one of us is vegetarian (usually would get impossible burger, curds or cauliflower wings) ",8,32,2025-04-01 20:31:52,1jpcr3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1jpcr3g/good_city_brewing_now_wayfinder/,milwaukee,general_food

cafe,I’m running for Chair of the Democratic Party of Milwaukee County,"Edit: my name is Amy Donahue.

Want to ask me questions and find out more? Register for my virtual meet & greet on Tuesday 11/4 at 8:30pm.  

A little background: I decided to run for chair because I know my experiences as an organizer and leader, my Milwaukee county community networks, and my values have prepared me for this role. I am committed to building collective power, breaking down barriers to participation, and ensuring accountability. I will work with the other elected and appointed members of the board, party organizers, and volunteers to continue to grow the party membership, engage people in politics as voters, canvassers, and future elected officials; and work to recapture people who have lost faith in electoral politics. 

A little more about me: I am a white non-binary/trans parent, healthcare worker and small business owner, librarian, and organizer.  I’m in the Progressive (lol), LGBTQIA, and Environmental Caucuses of the state party. I am on the La Escuela Fratney School Engagement Council, on the board of the Riverwest Co-Op Grocery & Cafe, and represent Healthcare Workers for Palestine-Milwaukee with Wisconsin Coalition for Justice in Palestine. I've worked with Citizen Action of Wisconsin and am proud to support Leaders Igniting Transformation, African-American Roundtable, and Black Leaders Organizing for Communities. I'm also a member of Milwaukee Turners at Turner Hall. I’ll give a shout out to Milwaukee Ultimate and Milwaukee Medusa, as ultimate [frisbee] created some of my earliest opportunities to build my leadership skills. I'm the granddaughter of dairy farmers in upstate New York. I grew up in small towns and I've lived all over the country, but I've never felt more at home than I have since I came to Milwaukee in 2011.

And I don't know that I've ever felt this frustrated with the leadership of an organization I'm a part of. There are many good people involved and I respect (and truly know) the time and energy volunteer leadership requires. But the lack of transparency (from lack of financial reports to not sending out meeting agendas ahead of time), the cliquishness, the resistance to democratic processes - we have to root these out of our own Democratic Party of Milwaukee County backyard if we truly want to fight fascism, stand up for working people, and help Wisconsin “win the trifecta.”

Despite my best efforts I haven’t yet found a clear winner but I have found some odd hidden gems. If you have a pizza place that you think would score highly on Dave’s scale, please put it in the comments. 

Example Pizza I’m looking for: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFBN0deyhlh/?igsh=a2E1cXMycTRpdjk=

Honorable Mentions
1) Glorioso’s - Weirdly enough, gloriosos, the grocery store, makes a pretty good, flavorful, and crispy pizza.
2) Classic Slice - For me this pizza is reliable but not what I’m searching for. Too much flop, not enough flavor. 
3) Flour Girl and Flame - SOOOO flavorful and yummy, but doesn’t have the crunch factor.
4) Papa Luigi’s - Good pizza to order on a night in. Not the correct style of pizza. Greesy. Lot of flop. Good flavor. Crunch like a cracker but this isn’t the right type of crunch I’m looking for. 

Edit: I agree w/ comments. Not a Dave P fan but figured it would be a good discriptor for pizza people. ",0,53,2025-01-26 17:07:23,1iataqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1iataqg/best_crispy_pizza/,milwaukee,general_food

pizza,"Moving from Menomonee Falls to WFB/Shorewood for a ""walkable"" childhood? Is this realistic?","My family is considering a move from the Menomonee Falls/Sussex area to Whitefish Bay or Shorewood, and I'm looking for a reality check. We know the trade-off would be getting a smaller home than we have now  and likely more in property taxes, but we're trying to prioritize a different lifestyle.

I have two kids (9 and 6). We currently live in a land-locked subdivision where nothing is walkable. It feels very insular. It seems like all the kids in our area are overscheduled, and there’s almost no spontaneous play. If kids get together, it's always a pre-arranged ""play date."" On top of that, lots of people in our neighborhood send their kids to private schools, so the shared public school experience that was the ""glue"" for kids in my neighborhood growing up doesn't exist to the same extent here.

My biggest concern is that I feel like kids build self-confidence by learning to do age-appropriate things independently. The version of independence I had as a kid just doesn't seem possible here.

I admit I'm nostalgic for my own upbringing. I could walk home from school. As I got older, I could ride my bike to parks, the public pool, and even a diner to get a burger with friends. We had friends in the neighborhood we could just go hang out with.

My main question is: **Am I being nostalgic for a** ***time*** **(the 90s) or a** ***place?***

For those of you living in Whitefish Bay or Shorewood:

* Do kids actually walk or ride bikes to school?
* Do you see groups of kids (say, 9-12 year olds) on bikes heading to the park, the library, or to grab a slice of pizza on their own?
* Is ""just playing outside"" with neighborhood friends still a thing, or is everything as scheduled as it is out here?

I'm trying to figure out if I'm chasing something that doesn't exist anymore, or if that kind of neighborhood-centric, independent childhood is still possible in those communities.

Appreciate any insights.",128,215,2025-10-24 08:01:44,1oex4rq,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1oex4rq/moving_from_menomonee_falls_to_wfbshorewood_for_a/,milwaukee,general_food

pizza,Boston to MKE,"Hi all,

I am thinking of moving from my job's office in Boston over to Milwaukee, and am curious about the day to day life of you fine midwesterners. I really enjoyed a trip out to the MKE office when I visited earlier this year, but was stunned by how empty the city felt at night compared to Boston.

I have lived in Massachusetts my whole life and am looking for a change, but truthfully a big reason for me as well is that the cost of living in Boston is just too much to bear, even with a good job like mine. It is impossible to get an affordable studio or one bedroom and I don't want 5 roommates anymore lol. I want to know what sort of fun stuff there is to do in Milwaukee, great places to make friends, and just generally what you all love about this state and city.

Any advice is appreciated! :)

pizza,Carma pipe organ,"""Doors Open Milwaukee"" September 2025

Today I'm visiting in (what used to be) a warehouse for Carma Labs, the makers of Carmex lip balm. 

The owner (Paul) likes music & machines, and has assembled the world's largest theater pipe organ.  (""Because I can."" / ""Because I like it."")  

If I'm remembering correctly, it has over 90 ranks of instruments, most are in the loft behind dampers but some are out looking pretty. 

The smallest pipe is ""the size of a pencil"" and the largest is 32 feet tall.  (In the pictures, it's the square wooden one in the right back by the blue wall.) 

I have pictures & videos!!! 

Bonus - the artist-in-residence for Organ Piper Pizza of West Allis (Zach) is here playing today.

burger,Free burger complaint may have spurred 911 call in Brookfield,"> The Milwaukee Brewers scored their 12th-straight victory Wednesday in a win over the Pirates.

> That triggered a decades-old promotion from local diner chain George Webb, which promised free hamburgers if the Brewers won 12 games in a row.

> The free burgers, however, are not available right away.

> Apparently, one customer was not aware.

> According to dispatch audio obtained by WISN 12 News, police in Brookfield were called to the George Webb restaurant near Janacek and Bluemound Roads Tuesday for a customer's complaint.

> The dispatcher can be heard saying someone ""called 911 because they won't give him his free burgers for the Brewers game today. He was advised the game wasn't over yet. Not sure if the subject is standing by.""

Every time we get close (but not this close), George Webb doesn't have to come up with the hamburgers as there is no 12th win.

It may have been right next to Wick’s Liquor or possibly a few doors down. Bonus points if you can remember the brand of bottled soda they had there. I don’t think it was Sprecher.

3) Bayshore Mall food court, early 90s, was a burger/sandwich shop, may have had shakes and/or malts. I think it’s the spot that is now the Subway. It was on the same side as Rocky Roccoco’s and Chocolate Factory but was to the right of the doors and stairs leading up to the offices up above, whereas Chocolate Factory was just to the left of those doors.

Anyone have any insight on if Mo’s is struggling or just going through a rough patch? It was pretty busy and well staffed so was just confused what was going on menu-wise.

East Town Kitchen + Bar,What's your small towns quirky feature/meme?,"For example, in my new town of Kiel, there is a pit of gravel just outside of town that literally looks like a mountain from the highway when you're approaching the city from the east. Bigger than any hill in the area. Residents who live nearby it complain of getting dust storms on windy days that leave them covered. There is even a local bar nicknamed after it: The Gravel Pit. It's kind of a meme, from what I gather. 

Similarly, in my hometown of horicon it was the train. There's a train that goes through that blocks pretty much all the main roads in town. There is a grain elevator nearby that it refills at, so it will literally be stationary or going back and forth at a snails pace most of the time. One time a bus was like 45+ minutes late to school because it got stuck behind it. My job in high school, strict on attendance, actually gave Horicon kids a pass on being late simply because of the train. Total meme.

What's your small town quirky feature?",121,122,2025-11-12 07:25:22,1ov528x,https://i.redd.it/6u818yx4vt0g1.jpeg,wisconsin,restaurant_mention
East Town Kitchen + Bar,Suggestions for places to retire in Wisconsin?,"My son has a job in Madison so my wife and I are checking out towns or neighborhoods in Wisconsin that could be good retirement locations. For the purpose of this post, we define good retirement locations as:

* Prefer a location with a population in the 5,000 to 10,000 range but we are flexible.
* Looking for older homes, say built in 1940 or before, in the $300-$700K range with a front porch
* Homes are within walking distance to coffee shops, restaurants, bars, entertainment, grocery stores
* Someplace relatively quiet and safe
* In a perfect world the town/neighborhood has a fair number of mature trees
* Roughly, no more than a 2 hour drive to Madison

We have previously checked out Monroe, New Glarus, Stoughton, Spring Green, Viroqua, La Crosse, Baraboo, Shorewood, Whitefish Bay and the Upper East Side of Milwaukee. You don't seem to get much for your money in Madison and traffic, etc. seems to be getting worse, but tradeoffs can be made for the right neighborhood.

  
We are heading to Wisconsin in July to look at more places. Any suggestions for locations we should check out??

East Town Kitchen + Bar,Information for hunters re: missing people this season,"Greetings. As hunting season approaches, I am creating missing persons lists so people can help search while hunting.

Despite having only 222 missing adults and 31 children on national databases NamUs and NCMEC for all of Wisconsin, Milwaukee ALONE has [over 500 missing people at any time](https://mediamilwaukee.com/special-projects/missing-in-milwaukee/).

The laws and procedures in Wisconsin do not require reporting missing people to these databases. Therefore, the true epidemic of missing people is misunderstood as even news sources misreport the number.

I do not have access to the full list of missing people – only the police have that. However, these are the reported missing below. They are some of the cold cases – also a few newer ones. These all deserve attention for the sake of the families. I've listed them below, also a link to a page with more information for each. Please keep on the lookout for them as well as evidence of them. I am doing this to help these families get some closure, so please don’t downvote. There are a couple I have left out because of recent developments, but most are here.

East Town Kitchen + Bar,Fish Fry in western WI update,"I posted about a year ago, looking for suggestions for a fish fry place in western Wisconsin. We’ve been living here for almost a year and I’ve been wanting to update this in case anyone is thinking of visiting or moving here.

We’ve realized that Friday fish fry is more of an eastern Wisconsin tradition, but there are many places trying to incorporate a version here too. The biggest issue for my partner is that apparently there is an aversion to rye bread here, not sure if it’s generational or cultural. We’ve heard both stories. We have come across rye bread, and the story of our quest for decent bakery bread could fill another post but the bakers of rye bread and the fish fry establishments have yet to meet up. Pretty much all the fish we’ve encountered is cod. I like cod, and it certainly holds up well deep fried. In no particular order, this is where we’ve gone:

1. The Laurel supper club outside New Richmond. Everything was wonderful here, it was a real treat. Cloth napkins, hardworking staff, loyal patrons. It’s a little far for us but we plan to return in November because my partner wants to try the duck for his birthday. Big money, but worth it.
2. Saltie Kitchen and bar, New Richmond (formerly Mallard’s). This place is in “downtown” New Richmond, and we were there just as they were transitioning from Mallards to Saltie. The server assured us that the recipes wouldn’t change and they would continue to have Friday fish fry. It doesn’t appear on the menu but they did have a chalk sign and pretty much everyone we saw there was having fish. This place was pretty good, and actually had a choice between cod and walleye. I’m suspicious about walleye as other fish are often substituted for walleye in restaurants but the cod was fine.  Kind of an odd atmosphere, a small town place trying to be a cool city place but everything was clean and the food was attentively prepared.  We’d go back.
3. Junior’s in Amery. Similar in many ways to our experience at Saltie’s but a step down in quality.  Perhaps they were busier and understaffed the Friday evening we were there in summer but everything took a long time, starting with getting a menu. They had no beer list.  The server said it was in her head, but she couldn’t tell us what was on it. Fish was ok but not memorable. Probably won’t return.
4. The Watershed in Osceola. The fish, walleye, was magnificent. But that sets up a problem because I’ve heard from other people that it’s uneven. You order at the counter when you come in and that can be a long wait. It’s not really a Wisconsin fish fry either, although it comes with cole slaw. It's a large piece of walleye, fried in batter, served on a wood plate with no edges. Some fries and the slaw. I have mixed feelings but I’d probably go again.  We live in Osceola, so I’ve been here a few times for other things and I’ve never had a bad experience.  It’s not super comfortable though, and it’s noisy.  I think it’s a strength that it’s not in any way a bar (like most other places in this, and other, towns.) I think a non-drinker would be most comfortable here.  Are there any non-drinkers in Wisconsin? Anyway, many of the patrons come across from Minnesota.  Shout out to the really beautiful local art, especially the ceramic art on the walls, much of which is done by Guillermo Cuellar whose studio is just across the river. 
5. Brothers Country Mart- the address is Osceola but really this is in Nye, which I guess is something few people will own up to knowing because something happened there long before we moved here.  Hear me out, this is an odd place, but the fish fry is good. Straight up, it’s not a bar or a restaurant.  It’s a gas station. A typical Wisconsin store that sells a wide range of food items, far from just snacks and candy. Of course it’s a liquor store too. I have no idea how they are preparing the food, and there has rarely (ok once) been anyone else there but they have tables.  Lots of people are picking up take out. The manager, Natalia, is sharp and keeps track of everything that goes on up there.  She remembered us and our names months after we had visited the first time.  I just really like this place. People here have strong feelings about the owners and some people won’t go here just because.  But we like it. 

1. The Dulles Supper Club in St. Croix Falls.  Wow, I don’t know what we were expecting, maybe sort of a stripper bar but this was a class act all the way. A real throw back to Wisconsin supper club tradition.  If we go back it will be with a reservation and better clothes because as a walk in they stuck us far far away from the main room.  The food was very good and the service was excellent and really attentive.  The popovers are to die for. Overall it felt like we had stepped into 1978. But with 2025 prices of course.  They were really nice, just busy and did their best to accommodate two strangers.  

Someone suggested Wolter’s in Amery when I posted before.  So far we have not been there.  I’m a little suspicious because they are ALWAYS looking for staff. We also went to one of the Not Justa places this week for breakfast and realized they do fish fry.  We’ll probably try that soon. Feel free to toss any other suggestions on here!

La Caribeña The best Caribbean family restaurant,Possible ICE agents in Racine,"Hello! I don't know how to spread the word, but about 15 minutes ago I was driving on 20 and between Lathrop and Ohio there were about 5 unmarked vehicles that pulled to the side and a bunch of men came out in vests and what not. I don't know for sure if they are ICE agents as I was driving and didn't get the best look but I want to get a warning out to the community. Please be careful friends and know your rights! PS. I cross posted this on the Racine page to try to push the word out further.

Edit: someone on the Racine subreddit said it is ICE and they are detaining people

Another edit: If you spot ICE anywhere, please call Voces de la Frontera at 800-427-0213 to report it! Another person on here gave it to me, and I did call. Since it was almost 2 hours past when I saw them, there's nothing much they can do, but they took note. I have this number saved for next time. Please save it in your phone and pass it to friends and family.

La Caribeña The best Caribbean family restaurant,"Thinking of making the leap from the Caribbean to Wisconsin, what’s the most important thing I should know?","Wausau specifically. I’ve visited Wisconsin a couple times, but not for a long period. I currently work fine dining bar two shifts, locals dive bar three shifts, and a charter yacht on average once a month for a week. I might continue working the winters here for high season, but I’d be living stateside for the summers for sure. What should I expect? Best food there? Are people more reserved or friendly? Bucket list must dos?

ETA: Thanks everyone for the insight and replies!!!

The main reason I’m moving is because I have someone I fell in love with a long time ago when we were kids really. Throughout our lives we’ve remained close, and he’s asked me to marry him several times, but I was always afraid to leave the island. He can’t move here because of family issues and his company he started and has worked his entire life to build is there. I don’t have the same ties here, so it would have to be me that would move. 

Recently I sat down and looked long and hard at my life, and I realized I’ve lived nearly half of it without him, and I’d rather live the rest with him, regardless of where he is. There is also a way we can compromise, especially because winters are one of the biggest challenges. I could continue to work the season here, which runs Nov-Mar, and make enough money to take the rest of the year off or working part time, the same as I do now, I would just be changing my residence to Wisconsin. And tbh it would be awfully nice to have things like reliable power, stocked grocery stores, decent healthcare. 

Also, I appreciate very much the insight and thoughts from people of color, which I am not, but will be aware of how those who are continue to be treated terribly in the states. I am so sorry that anyone experiences that and they should never have to.

Once again, thank you all so much! If I didn’t give this a chance I feel like I would regret it. This time when he asks, I will say yes.

La Caribeña The best Caribbean family restaurant,Teachers looking to move to WI from Vegas...tips on where to live?,"Long read ahead, sorry in advance if you manage to make it through!

Me and my (soon-to-be) husbands would love some advice about possibly moving to wisconsin in a few years. To start, we're both teachers. I teach Kindergarten but could teach anything K-5, and my partner teaches high school history, but has also taught middle school and would be willing to do either.

We're looking at Wisconsin for a few different reasons. We love the packers, he's from the midwest (Iowa) but doesnt want to live there again, and I love the PNW but we're priced out and its too difficult to get a teaching job up there. We both grew up in super small towns but are tired of living in our huge city and want to raise our family in a small or mid sized town. We've also both lived in cold climates (Iowa and norther Idaho) but not as cold as I imagine most of Wisconsin gets. We have read a lot about recent WI education system struggles, but even with Act 10, its still significantly better than where we are in Las Vegas so thats not a concern of ours, but ability to get a job is. We're slightly concerned that most of the towns we're interested in won't have two teacher vacancies at the same time. We also love job security, so a higher needs district or one with a lot of other school district nearby that we could commute to.

Our ideal setting would be a mid-sized town of around 10-30k where kids actually play on lawns and there's town events that keeps the community engaged with each other. Neither one of us enjoys much of a nightlife outside a causal restaurant so ammenities like that arent a requirment. Large box stores within 30 miles is a strong bonus though, especially once we have children. We both love nature - camping, hiking, snowboarding/skiing, and he used to like biking. Living near nature (trees) is a requirement for me. Also, we're looking to settle down long-term and would like to live somewhere thats friendly to transports. We dont want us or our kids to have a hard time socializing because we're not from there.

So far, here's our (super-long) list of options:

\- Ashland

\- Hayward

\- Eagle River or Rhinelander (read mixed reviews)

\- Stevens Point, Wasau, Waupaca, Wisconsin Rapids, or Marshfield

\- Port Edwards (cant find much info)

\- Eau Claire or Chippewa Falls

\- La crosse (seems so highly reccomended but I think we'll need to visit to understand why)

\- Sturgeon bay, fish creek, sister bay, two rivers

\- De Pere

\- Port Washington, Sheboygan, or Cedarburg

\- Elkhart Lake

\- Lake Geneva

\- Baraboo or Wisconsin Dells (read mixed things)

\- Hudson

Any advice on if ant these towns would be a good place to settle down long-term and raise a family?

La Caribeña The best Caribbean family restaurant,Celebrating 30 years Anniversary in Wisconsin Dells – need some advice,"Hi everyone! My husband and I are celebrating our **30th wedding anniversary** in November. We’re planning a trip to Wisconsin Dells. Our two adult kids will join us for a couple of days because we’re renewing our vows, and then we’ll stay the rest of the week just the two of us.

We’re fairly familiar with the area and have vacationed there several times, but need some advice on a few details. I’m feeling a bit alone planning all this and would really appreciate the help. I’d love to get reservations and details set soon, so thank you, Reddit friends!

**• Place to stay:**  
We’re thinking about **Wilderness on the Lake**. A few years ago we stayed in a two-bedroom condo with a jacuzzi, which was nice, but our lake view was almost completely blocked. If anyone knows or remembers which units have the best view of the lake, I’d really appreciate the tip.  
Or do you think a **Frontier Condominium** (or another lakefront spot) might be a better choice for couples?

**• Vow renewal:**  
We want something small and nice, just the four of us. We were considering **Dells Bells Wedding Chapel** downtown. Has anyone gotten married or renewed their vows there? Was it a good experience?  
Any other ideas for a simple, intimate renewal are also welcome.

**• Restaurant:**  
We’d love recommendations for a nice dinner spot afterward, somewhere with good food, a relaxed atmosphere, but still special enough to celebrate as a family.

Thanks so much in advance for any advice, memories, or suggestions you can share. 

**TL;DR:**  
Celebrating our 30th anniversary in Wisconsin Dells in November. Need tips on:

* Best lake-view units at Wilderness on the Lake (or other good places to stay)
* Dells Bells Wedding Chapel experiences or vow renewal ideas
* Nice restaurant for a small family dinner
* Any other ideas, advice or suggestions",0,27,2025-10-09 10:59:02,1o29sxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/1o29sxg/celebrating_30_years_anniversary_in_wisconsin/,wisconsin,restaurant_mention

Screaming Tuna Milwaukee,Looking for a quiet resort on the water,"My wife and I need to vacate our house for a weekend at the end of July. We would like to go to  a place that’s relaxing and on the water. As we are an older couple, we would appreciate a place that’s quiet and without screaming kids or wild parties.

La Dama | Mexican Kitchen & Bar,Looking for locals' opinions on Lake Geneva dining and beaches,"A group of us (\~27F, one under 21, from Chicagoland) are visiting Lake Geneva this weekend for my friend's bachelorette trip. We'll be there Friday afternoon through Sunday afternoon and we'll be staying at an Airbnb north of Lake Como. I've done my research and have a good sense of our food/beverage/entertainment options. Looking for locals' input to finalize our itinerary, especially if there are things to know about wait times, reservations, and parking for large groups. 

**Best restaurant for Friday night takeout?** Considering Sabai Sabai, Next Door Pub (their lakeside location), and Papa's Blue Spruce Resort (maybe also Los Tres Hermanos or Oakfire, though the latter seems better for dining in). 

**Best coffee?** We'll be making our own breakfast at the Airbnb, but I imagine we'll also make a morning coffee run. Ideally we'll try two different places on Saturday and Sunday. Considering Inspired, The Porch, Boxed and Burlap, Niche, and House of Music Café (Coffee Mill also looks great but is a 20 min drive). 

**Best light lunch in or near Downtown Lake Geneva?** Considering Simple Café and Joni's Diner (maybe also Popeye's). Looking for healthy-ish wraps, sandwiches, salads. 

**Best dinner after a wine tasting at Studio Winery?** I see that Next Door Pub  is close by, but considering also PIER 290, Barrique Bistro, and Flat Iron. Sopra also looks great but unsure about $$$. Oakfire and Sabai Sabai could also be put back on the table if not chosen on Friday. My friend likes Italian so Cafe Calamari is also on my radar (Tuscan Tavern doesn't seem like the right vibe, and Sweet Aroma is a bit far away).

**Best ice cream / dessert?** Here's what I've gathered, please feel free to correct me: Gelato from Medusa Kitchen seems like a must. I know Scoops is popular because they serve Chocolate Shoppe ice cream, but there's also places in Chicago that sell it so maybe not a stop on this trip, although it is in a convenient location. For non-ice cream in the Downtown area, O2 looks great for bubble tea. Something Sweet has favorable ratings but I can't really tell what's distinctive about it? Outside of Lake Geneva, which would you choose between Blue Heaven, Dip in the Bay, Meggy Moo's, and The Frosty Moose? I wish I had five stomachs. Last I'll mention are the tiramisu, cannolis, and cakes from Riga-Tony's, and, if I happen upon them at a coffee shop, baked goods from Pastries by Chad.

**Best beach?** I've seen Fontana Beach recommended over the Riviera Beach, although the parking is more expensive. Thoughts? We were planning to go on Sunday, weather-permitting, and I was thinking we could get grab & go sandwiches from either Green Grocer or The Cheese Shop, or get lunch at Chuck's Lakeshore Inn if Fontana is indeed the move. If it's too cold I'm thinking either a walk along the Lake Shore Path (starting at the library), booking a Drive-Through Safari, or hanging out at either Chuck's Lakeshore Inn, Mars Resort, or Magpie's OR, for a bougier vibe, Barrique Bistro, PIER 290, The Bottle Shop, or Niche Cafe and Wine Bar? Whichever we haven't already visited, basically. 

If you've made it this far, thanks for enduring the Type A-ness of it all. I appreciate any suggestions/help in narrowing down these options. Lake Geneva, Como, Williams Bay, Fontana, and perhaps even Delavan are fair game for additional recommendations. 

  
P.S. Just to mention, we won't be doing much night life, so unfortunately I don't think we'll be going to The Apothecary or speakeasy at Maxwell Mansion or any breweries like Topsy Turvy, etc. As for shopping, I think we'll pop into The Candle Mercantile and the Market of Lake Geneva. Otherwise, we'll be playing it by ear.",1,11,2025-05-20 15:34:01,1krffq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/1krffq9/looking_for_locals_opinions_on_lake_geneva_dining/,wisconsin,restaurant_mention

Michael’s Family Restaurant,Considering a move Up North,"Hi all!  I’m getting a bit tired of the chaos and cost of living in Milwaukee, and we are considering a move to Tomahawk/Rhinelander/Minoqua area.  We have some family up there, and love to spend time hiking, cabining, SUP boarding, and just relaxing outdoors smelling the pines with our dogs. 

Buuuuuut I also like Indian Restaurants, Pilates classes, Third Ward shopping, concerts, having a diverse social circle, and progressive politics…

Anyone else made the move and had a blast?  Anyone made the move and regretted it?

EDIT: I appreciate your “move elsewhere” suggestions, but I would be moving to be close to family and for a job (significant upgrade) so there isn’t an option to just choose another area.  It’s either stay put to move to T-Hawk/Minoqua… or somewhere a bit North of Wausau.",33,128,2025-08-20 21:22:45,1mvyqfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/1mvyqfq/considering_a_move_up_north/,wisconsin,restaurant_mention

Michael’s Family Restaurant,"""Up North"" family-cabin-on-a-lake suggestions? (Including Lake Superior/Michigan)","Decades ago I used to go with my family as a kid to super fun, very basic cabins on lakes in northern Wisconsin. The kind with an ancient pinball machine in the bait shop that cost a dime to play, and john-boats that you could rent and paddle around in to go fishing. Now I want to bring my own offspring, but I don't know where to go because that was a long time ago and I only moved back here recently. Suggestions? Kids are teen+ and they like this kind of thing.

I do not want ""luxury."" I want nature and quiet and relaxation -- so very strongly prefer motor-free water with no jet skis. (Bonus points for anything with easy access to Lake Superior, which I realize is a whole nother level of Lake.) Would be cool if there was a town nearby with a classic supper club / steak house type thing. Or, um, good espresso and an awesome hippie food vegetarian restaurant.

\*Editing\* to say that I don't necessarily want a hippie *vibe*. In fact am hoping for old-fashioned north woods. I just really like good vegetarian rice-and-beans type food. A hole-in-the-wall Mexican place would fit the bill perfectly. Also, re motors-- pontoons and some guy out in a john boat with a little motor are actually OK. Just nothing loud and obnoxious.

Michael’s Family Restaurant,Town by town public kitchens,"Some towns likely have this although I haven't seen it personally in this exact way - I've seen things more like soup kitchens that are ran by non-profits, that type of thing.  This would be more like a town by town, county county, state by state, or even federally funded (not in this admin), public kitchen.  I picture a building that would have a large kitchen, multiple cooking spots, fridges, pantries, etc.  Many towns have this existing as a senior center sort of thing already. Some of it used by state or federally employed cooks that would churn out cafeteria style food that is free for anyone, donation optional.  Would not need to be fancy, the idea is to feed people who need/want it.  Additional spaces open for those who would like to cook for themselves, or be used as part of cooking classes to help teach those who would like it to be more self-sufficient on the cooking front.

It would need some employees to support it because of course we can't have nice things, and people ruin things, but I wonder if things like this already exist.

Bottom line - the US is still the 10th richest country in the world, and we should be able to ensure that the poorest are fed.

Edit:  Wisconsin specific because I'm curious if people think it would work in the state but also nationally.

Here's all the AI crap it spewed back at me when I asked.  Just had a random thought this morning.

The Case for Public Kitchens in Every Town (500+ Residents)

# 🌍 1. Food Security and Dignity

* **Universal access to meals**: A public kitchen guarantees that no resident goes hungry, regardless of income or employment status.
* **Emergency support**: In times of crisis—natural disasters, pandemics, economic downturns—a public kitchen becomes a lifeline.
* **Dignified aid**: Unlike food banks or soup kitchens, a public kitchen can be designed as a welcoming, community-centered space that removes stigma.

# 🏛️ 2. Government Responsibility and Efficiency

* **Preventative investment**: Hunger leads to health issues, crime, and reduced productivity. Feeding people is cheaper than treating the consequences.
* **Streamlined aid**: Instead of fragmented food assistance programs, a public kitchen centralizes resources and reduces administrative overhead.
* **Local employment**: Staffing public kitchens creates jobs in food service, logistics, and management—boosting the local economy.

# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 3. Community Building

* **Shared meals foster connection**: Public kitchens can host communal dinners, cooking classes, and cultural events, strengthening social bonds.
* **Intergenerational engagement**: Seniors, youth, and families can all participate, volunteer, and benefit.
* **Civic pride**: A well-run public kitchen becomes a symbol of care and solidarity.

# 🌱 4. Sustainability and Local Agriculture

* **Support for local farmers**: Governments can source ingredients from nearby producers, stimulating rural economies.
* **Waste reduction**: Public kitchens can repurpose surplus food from grocery stores, restaurants, and farms.
* **Education on nutrition and sustainability**: Kitchens can teach healthy cooking and reduce reliance on processed foods.

# 💡 5. Scalable and Adaptable

* **Modular design**: A public kitchen can start small—shared cooking space, meal distribution—and grow with the town.
* **Tailored to local needs**: Menus and services can reflect cultural preferences, dietary restrictions, and seasonal availability.
* **Replicable success**: Pilot programs in cities like Helsinki, Seoul, and San Francisco show that public kitchens improve well-being and reduce inequality.

# 🔚 Final Thought

A public kitchen is not just a place to eat—it’s a declaration that every person matters. For towns of 500 or more, it’s a manageable, meaningful investment in health, equity, and community resilience.

# How It Could Be Paid For

# 1. Government Funding (Local, State, Federal)

* **Reallocation of existing budgets**: Redirect a portion of funds from food assistance programs, emergency services, or public health budgets. Public kitchens can reduce long-term costs in these areas.
* **Grants and subsidies**: Tap into federal programs like SNAP, USDA community food initiatives, or emergency food assistance grants.
* **Municipal budgets**: Cities and towns already fund public services like libraries and parks. A modest kitchen could be added to this portfolio.

# 2. Public-Private Partnerships

* **Local businesses**: Restaurants, grocers, and farms can donate surplus food or sponsor meals in exchange for tax incentives or community goodwill.
* **Nonprofits and foundations**: Many organizations are eager to fund food justice, sustainability, or community-building initiatives.
* **Corporate social responsibility (CSR)**: Companies can contribute funds, equipment, or volunteers.

# 3. Community Contributions

* **Sliding-scale pricing**: Those who can afford to pay for meals do so, subsidizing others. Think of it like a “pay what you can” café.
* **Volunteer labor**: Community members can help with cooking, cleaning, and organizing events, reducing staffing costs.
* **Fundraisers and events**: Public kitchens can host community dinners, cooking classes, or festivals to raise money and awareness.

# 🌱 Is It Sustainable?

# Yes—if designed smartly. Here’s how:

* **Economies of scale**: Centralized kitchens reduce per-meal costs compared to individual food aid or emergency responses.
* **Food waste reduction**: By using surplus food from local producers and grocers, kitchens lower both costs and environmental impact.
* **Health savings**: Providing nutritious meals reduces long-term healthcare costs related to malnutrition, obesity, and chronic disease.
* **Social ROI**: Public kitchens foster community resilience, reduce crime, and improve mental health—benefits that far outweigh the costs.

# Real-World Precedents

* **India’s Amma Unavagam**: Government-run canteens in Tamil Nadu serve millions of meals daily at ultra-low prices, funded by the state.
* **Seoul’s Community Kitchens**: Subsidized by the city, they serve seniors and low-income residents while reducing food waste.
* **San Francisco’s Free Meals Program**: During the pandemic, the city partnered with restaurants to provide meals to residents in need, proving the model works even in high-cost areas.

# 🧮 Ballpark Cost Estimate

For a town of 500:

* **Startup**: \~$50,000–$100,000 (equipment, space retrofitting)

Story Hill BKC,'I'm a member of Congress': GOP rep erupts after being accused of doing Trump's bidding,"

Most times actions speak louder than words.

Congressman Derrick Van Orden took offense at the suggestion he's failing his constituents and the people of Wisconsin by voting for Trump's big Beautiful Bill. Yet some provisions of the provisions of the bill will directly impact 850,000 residents of Wisconsin who rely on government assistance for healthcare for their families and food for their children.

'I'm a member of Congress': GOP rep erupts after being accused of doing Trump's bidding

Story by Carl Gibson • 1

One House Republican who is in voting yes on H.R. 1 (President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"") is bristling at the suggestion that he's a rubber stamp for the White House. NBC News Capitol Hill correspondent Melanie Zanona tweeted Wednesday that Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-Wis.) didn't take kindly to the idea that Republicans simply ""do w\[h\]atever Trump says."" He reportedly used profanity in his official statement to Zanona as he emphasized his argument that he votes with his constituents in mind.

“The president of the United States didn't give us an assignment. We're not a bunch of little b-----s around here okay?"" Van Orden said. ""I'm a member of Congress. I represent almost 800,000 Wisconsinnites\[sic\].” However, Van Orden's assertion that he's voting for the legislation because his constituents want it would be an anomaly, given the overwhelming unpopularity of Trump's first domestic policy package of his second term. A Quinnipiac University poll from late June found that 59% of respondents opposed the bill, while just 29% of those polled were in favor of it.

The bill is particularly reviled due to its cuts to Medicaid — the program that provides health insurance for low-income and disabled Americans. The Senate version of the bill cuts Medicaid by approximately $1 trillion over a ten-year period in order to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts (that primarily benefit the wealthiest Americans). Roughly 11.8 million Americans could lose their health insurance if the Senate's version of the bill becomes law, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

H.R. 1 also cuts funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, or food stamps) by hundreds of billions of dollars, which could throw nearly three million Americans off of food stamps. If signed into law, SNAP could see its funding reduced by roughly 20% — the largest cut in history.

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), Wisconsin' 3rd Congressional District (which Van Orden represents) has more than 150,000 Medicaid beneficiaries who could lose their health insurance if Trump's budget bill passes. And 2022 data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture found that there are almost 700,000 Badger State residents who rely on SNAP to afford food.

Story Hill BKC,My Lil’ Drifty Experience 2025,"[The Lil’ Drifty](https://www.lost.travel/experiences/the-lil-drifty) is this weird little adventure in Wisconsin that mixes biking, paddling, and camping. I tried it last year and didn’t make it. This year I went back with one goal: to finish. Spoiler: I actually did.

**Day 1 – Thursday**

I rolled into Token Creek State Park sweating through my shirt, set up my tent, and tried to convince myself this was a good idea. By evening the group started to gather—tents scattered everywhere, coolers full of drinks, and a food truck for dinner. We ended the night around a bonfire with fortune cards. Mine? “Take a selfie with someone named Jerry.” I didn’t even know a Jerry… yet.

**Day 2 – Friday**

Donuts, bagels, and champagne for breakfast. Our group of seven women set out together, stopping for cheese curds, signing the ceiling tile at a bar, and watching goats climb on a saloon roof. At one point, one of us crashed hard, but she got patched up and back on the bike. By afternoon we traded pedals for paddles, cramming all our gear into canoes. The river was choppy, but we eventually landed on a sandbar where I ate a PB&J, took a river bath, downed a Cherry McGillicuddy, and passed out in my tent.

**Day 3 – Saturday**

At 3 a.m., my stomach decided to revolt. Not fun when you’re dehydrated and stuck on a sandbar with no bathroom. Somehow by morning I rallied, and we made it to the next checkpoint. That’s where the group voted: forget camping, let’s find a hotel. Smartest decision of the trip. The biking that day was brutal. Endless hills, heat, and nearly 40 miles. By the time we rolled into Verona, thunderstorms were chasing us, but we made it inside just in time. I have never been so grateful for a shower, clean sheets, and AC.

https://preview.redd.it/i9enbcrnl6sf1.png?width=609&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d185bdd6828b876e253000631dfcc6eda94abd7

**Day 4 – Sunday**

Still raining, but hotel breakfast works wonders. We grabbed Goodwill ponchos and set off for the final stretch. We even stopped to “Jump Around” at Camp Randall before cruising into the finish line at Working Draft. Waiting for us: cold beers, pretzels, pizza, and live music.

https://preview.redd.it/2opiu5n5l6sf1.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed2cf128deef420fcec02d93b807d979684b223c

When I looked back, we had done 20+ miles paddling and over 90 miles biking. I was sore, exhausted, and ridiculously proud. And of course… I already signed up for next year.

Because that’s the Lil’ Drifty. It’s messy, unpredictable, and at times completely miserable. But it’s also friendship, grit, and the kind of story you’ll keep telling long after you cross the finish line.

“They think it’s a great opportunity to bring West Coast coffee culture to the Midwest,” Helbach told the Milwaukee Business Journal. “It’s really a step towards a more hospitality-focused, multifamily-living lifestyle experience that we offer at Neutral,” Helbach said, adding that all tenants will get a free coffee each morning and access to a co-working space.",60,18,2025-06-12 08:52:26,1l9n14v,https://woodcentral.com.au/worlds-tallest-timber-building-to-break-ground-in-milwaukee-next-week/,wisconsin,restaurant_mention

Swingin' Door Exchange,I’m in Door County and just saw something super weird go over us in the sky,"I can’t imagine what it was.  I’m an aviation enthusiast, so I know what planes look like.

I checked ADS-B and there were no planes around (I contribute to ABS-Exchange so I have a free account).

The sky was clearing after a very slight drizzle.  

I’ve seen photos of what rockets look like as they’re being boosted into space - but why over peninsula state park seems like a weird trajectory.  We’re in Nicolet Bay - the photo is facing north.

I know the photo sucks - it seemed to “hang” in the same place for a long time.   Could this be because whatever it is - maybe a rocket - is flying away but from my angle it’s not defecting at an angle to make it look different?  I don’t really know what I just said.

When I called DNR they were fine with our late return. But I need to call back to make sure I don’t have to like leave a tent or anything…?

Stella Van Buren,What the F is wrong with Neenah WI?,"Apparently they, along either an anonymous billionaire donor (take a guess who) put up a bench saying “Zip De Do Dah” from Disney’s Song of the South movie (the racist one) and a bronze statue of Davy Crockett with a misleading and false plaque.

Davy Crockett was a scout and a milita man, think proud boys/ICE agents to clear the West of Native Americans. He participated in the massacre of Native Americans during the Red Stick Creek War. “We now shoot them like dogs.” Davy Crockett. He opposed Andrew Jackson sending Native Americans west because he was clearing the land.
He would fight with Texas to kill and remove all Mexicans from America. 

He was part of the Republican Party and strongly opposed to the Democratic Party specifically Van Buren who was anti-slavery.

The City sold land to this donor for the multiple bronze statues littering the city. This statue is in a prominent public park which means the city may have sold off part of the public park for this racist, anti government, anti Democratic Party and anti Mexican and Native American display.

Sanford,Need travel advice,"Hi everyone!
I am in florida and my bf goes to wisconsin every summer for work and I let him take my car because his car is too old for the journey.
Anyway, I have to get my car back so I decided on getting a one way rental car from my town in central fl to the Milwaukee Airport. Once I get there though I have to get from the Milwaukee Airport to where my car is in a town called Wisconsin Rapids. What is the cheapest way to get there? Is there a bus, or train or is uber even possible. is anyone from that town going to be at the airport next Tuesday and wants company on the ride home (jk).
But if anyone has tips let me know!
I had the option to drop the car in a town called wasau but it was 200$ more. 
There is also an airport in wasau but flights from either tampa or Orlando are ridiculous. Going to milwaukee seems like the cheapest option.
And yeah..my bf could help but he ""can't take time off work""

Thanks!!

Edit: thank you everyone! The bus only goes to Steven’s point now for those who need to know in the future. I called them. They must have torn down the bus station..idk. 

Edit again for anyone who cares..have a flight from Sanford  airport (about an hour from my house) to Appleton and since it lands at 10pm and is closer my bf will pick me up.
